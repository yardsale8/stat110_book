Comparing Two Population Means: Independent Samples
---------------------------------------------------

In Chapter 5, we considered inference for a single population mean.  Then, in
the first part of Chapter 6 we extended these ideas so that comparisons could be
made between two groups. Such comparisons were made using differences because
the observations in the two groups were related, or *dependent*.

In this section, we will consider making comparisons between two groups when the
observations in one group are *independent* of the observations in the other
group. The methodologies considered here are a bit more involved because it no
longer makes sense to simply work with differences. Consider the following
example.
