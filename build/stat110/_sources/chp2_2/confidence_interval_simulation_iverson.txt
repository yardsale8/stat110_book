Confidence Intervals with StatKey
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In `StatKey's Confidence Interval for a Single Proportion
<http://www.lock5stat.com/StatKey/bootstrap_1_cat/bootstrap_1_cat.html>`_ , 
we need to enter the statistic by clicking **Edit Data** and entering the
statistic, as shown below.

Then, we can use StatKey to get an idea of how much we expect this statistic to
change from one random sample to another. Similar to the TinkerPlots simulation,
The distribution of sample proportions obtained by repeated sampling is shown
below.

To get a 95% confidence interval for the parameter of interest, we find
both the *lower endpoint* and the *upper endpoint* that separate the
“middle” 95% of this distribution from the outer 5%. As before, this is
accomplished by clicking **two-tail** and setting the confidence level to the
desired value.

.. note::

    As before, you should **always** report your confidence interval in a
    well-formed sentence that describes the parameter of interest in the context
    of the problem.  For example, for the intervals shown above, we would write 

        *We are 95% confidence that the population proportion of all
        Minnesotans that feel medical marijuana should be legalized is between
        0.475 and 0.546* 

    Note that we are trying to estimate the value for the whole population,
    **not** the sample.
