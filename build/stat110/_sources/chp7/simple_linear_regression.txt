Introduction to Simple Linear Regression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, we will explore the basic idea behind regression analysis. A
simple linear regression model describes the relationship between a
numerical response variable (y) and a single predictor variable (x).

.. glossary::

    Response variable 
        The dependent variable, or the variable to be modeled.

    Predictor variable 
        The independent variable used as a predictor of the response.

To carry out a simple linear regression analysis in JMP, you can use the
**Analyze > Fit Y by X** menu\ **.** Place the y-variable in the **Y,
Response** box and the x-variable in the **X, Factor** box.

JMP returns the following output:

    To use the lion’s age to predict the proportion of nose blackness, we
    simply use the equation. For example, predict the proportion of nose
    blackness for a 4-year-old lion:

.. caution::

    Note that there are several underlying assumptions that
    must be met in order for us to use this regression model. These are
    discussed in detail in STAT 310.
