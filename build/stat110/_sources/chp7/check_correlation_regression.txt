    The images shown above was the JMP output for fitting FEV vs. age.  Use it to
    answer the following questions.

    .. mchoice:: check_correlation_1
        :answer_a: 0.432
        :answer_b: 0.222
        :answer_c: 0.757
        :answer_d: 1.000
        :correct: c
        :feedback_a: Line up FEV and Age in the correlation table.
        :feedback_b: Line up FEV and Age in the correlation table.
        :feedback_d: Line up FEV and Age in the correlation table.
        
        What is the correlation coefficient for these data?

    .. mchoice:: interpret_correlation_1
        :answer_a: Strong
        :answer_b: Moderately Strong
        :answer_c: Weak
        :correct: a
        :feedback_b: A correlation coefficient over about 0.7 indicates a strong relationship
        :feedback_c: A correlation coefficient over about 0.7 indicates a strong relationship

        Based on the correlation coefficient, how would you rate the strength of this linear association?

    .. mchoice:: interpret_correlation_2
        :answer_a: Positive
        :answer_b: Negative
        :answer_c: No direction
        :correct: a
        :feedback_a: A positive correlation coefficient indicates a positive direction.
        :feedback_b: A negative direction is indicated by a negative correlation coefficient.
        :feedback_c: No direction is indicated by a correlation coefficient close to zero.

        Based on the correlation coefficient, determine the direction of the association.

    .. mchoice:: check_slope_1
        :answer_a: 0.432
        :answer_b: 0.222
        :answer_c: 0.757
        :answer_d: 1.000
        :correct: b
        :feedback_a: The slope is the coefficient that is multiplied by Age
        :feedback_c: The slope is the coefficient that is multiplied by Age
        :feedback_d: The slope is the coefficient that is multiplied by Age
        
        What is the slope of the least-squares regression line?

    .. mchoice:: check_intercept_1
        :answer_a: 0.432
        :answer_b: 0.222
        :answer_c: 0.757
        :answer_d: 1.000
        :correct: a
        :feedback_b: The y-intercept is the constant in the equation.
        :feedback_c: The y-intercept is the constant in the equation.
        :feedback_d: The y-intercept is the constant in the equation.
        
        What is the y-intercept of the least-squares regression line?
