Example 5.1: 
-------------

A study conducted by researchers at Pennsylvania State
University investigated whether time perception, a simple indication of
a person’s ability to concentrate, is impaired during nicotine
withdrawal. The study results were presented in the paper “Smoking
Abstinence Impairs Time Estimation Accuracy in Cigarette Smokers”
(*Psychopharmacology Bulletin* [2003]: 90-95). After a 24-hour smoking
abstinence, 20 smokers were asked to estimate how much time had passed
during a 45-second period. Suppose the resulting data on perceived
elapsed time (in seconds) were analyzed as shown below (these results
are artificial but are similar to the actual findings). The data can be
found in the file **Nicotine1.JMP**.

We can use JMP to summarize the data as follows:

    :answer_a: Yes
    :answer_b: No
    :correct: b
    :feedback_a: We would expect some variability from one sample the the next.
    :feedback_b: We would expect some variability from one sample the the next.

    If another sample of \(n = 20\) subjects were obtained, would these new
    subjects have a mean exactly the same as the mean from this
    sample? Why or why not?
