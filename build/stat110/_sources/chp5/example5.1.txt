Example 5.1: 
-------------

A study conducted by researchers at Pennsylvania State
University investigated whether time perception, a simple indication of
a person’s ability to concentrate, is impaired during nicotine
withdrawal. The study results were presented in the paper “Smoking
Abstinence Impairs Time Estimation Accuracy in Cigarette Smokers”
(*Psychopharmacology Bulletin* [2003]: 90-95). After a 24-hour smoking
abstinence, 20 smokers were asked to estimate how much time had passed
during a 45-second period. Suppose the resulting data on perceived
elapsed time (in seconds) were analyzed as shown below (these results
are artificial but are similar to the actual findings). The data can be
found in the file **Nicotine1.JMP**.

We can use JMP to summarize the data as follows:

.. admonition:: Questions:

    1. What is the mean of the observed data? The standard deviation?

    2. If another sample of n=20 subjects were obtained, would these new
           subjects have a mean exactly the same as the mean from this
           sample? Why or why not?

    3. Given your answer to the previous question, do you think it is
           appropriate to use only this sample mean to make inferences about
           the mean perceived elapsed time in the greater population of all
           smokers subjected to nicotine withdrawal? Explain.
