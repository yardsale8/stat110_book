THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE SAMPLE MEAN
-----------------------------------

The sample mean is a random quantity; that is, it changes from sample to
sample. Therefore, the sample mean actually has its own distribution.
This distribution will tell us two things:

1. What values the sample mean can assume.

2. How often it will assume these values.

This distribution is referred to as the *distribution of the sample
mean*. An understanding of this distribution allows us to make decisions
about a population mean for a single numerical variable.

Exploring the Distribution of the Sample Mean
---------------------------------------------

Before we discuss the procedure for inference, let’s consider the next
example to gain a better understanding of how the distribution of sample
means works and how we use this distribution to make a decision
concerning our research question.

**Example 5.2:** Another “simulation study”….
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Suppose we set up a hypothetical population of smokers suffering from
nicotine withdrawal. This population has been purposefully created so
that the mean perceived elapsed time is exactly 45 seconds. 

|image1|

In this simulation study, what is our value of μ, the true population
mean?

Note that in reality, the true population mean is usually an unknown
quantity which we are trying to estimate. Since it is not feasible to
collect data on the entire population of smokers suffering from nicotine
withdrawal, the researchers took a random sample of 20 subjects in order
to estimate the average perceived elapsed time. Let’s see what happens
when we take various samples of size 20 from this population.

We can use Tinkerplots to carry out this simulation. Each of the
elements in the mixer represents the perceived elapsed time for a smoker
suffering from nicotine withdrawal in the population (e.g., the
highlighted subject thought that 50 seconds had passed during a
45-second period). We set the repeat value to 20 in order to randomly
select 20 subjects from the population for our study.

Click Run to randomly select our first sample of 20 subjects, and we can
then create a plot of their perceived elapsed times. Note that the mean
of these 20 subjects is shown on this plot.

Sample # 1:

.. admonition:: Questions:

    1. What is the average (or mean) perceived elapsed time of the 20
       subjects in this study?

    2. Does this necessarily mean that the average perceived elapsed time is
       greater than 45 seconds for *all* smokers suffering from nicotine
       withdrawal? What would you say to a researcher who tried to use only
       this sample mean to draw this conclusion?

Even though in reality we would carry out a study only once, we will
use Tinkerplots to take a sample of 20 subjects from this population
over and over again so that we get an idea of how much the sample mean
*could* change from sample to sample. Our second and third random
samples of 20 subjects and their sample means are shown below:

Sample #2:
++++++++++

|image4|

Sample #3:
++++++++++

|image5|

We can start to collect these sample means in a new plot to create the
distribution of sample means:

|image6|

To get a really good idea of what values are likely to occur by chance
when taking random samples of size 20 from the population, we should
take more than just three samples. The graphic below shows the process
we used to create the distribution of sample means and the final plot of
the means of 1,000 random samples.

|image7|

|image8|

This is a distribution of sample means. Recall that these 1,000 samples
(each consisting of 20 subjects) came from a population with a true mean
perceived elapsed time of 45 seconds. So, this distribution gives us a
good idea of what sample means from 20 subjects are likely (or unlikely)
to occur by chance if the true mean is 45 seconds.

Next, note that the researchers wanted to show that the mean perceived
elapsed time for smokers suffering from nicotine withdrawal was in
fact *greater* than 45 seconds. The null and alternative hypotheses to
address this research question are given as follows.

H\ :sub:`o`: The mean perceived elapsed time for smokers suffering
from nicotine withdrawal is equal
to 45 seconds.

H\ :sub:`a`: The mean perceived elapsed time for smokers suffering
from nicotine withdrawal is greater
than 45 seconds.

Note that the distribution of sample means was created assuming the null
hypothesis is true. To test this hypothesis, we compare our actual
observed mean to this null model. If the sample mean from the actual
research study is not likely to occur by chance according to this null
model (i.e., if it is an outlier on this null model), then we have
evidence against the null model and in support of the research question.

Recall that in the actual research study, the mean perceived elapsed
time for the 20 subjects studied was 55.05 seconds. Sketch this observed
value on the null model:

|image9|

There are two explanations for this observed mean of 55.05 seconds:
either (1) the true mean perceived elapsed time for smokers suffering
from nicotine withdrawal really is greater than 45 seconds, or (2) their
time perception is not impaired (i.e., the true mean is actually 45
seconds) and the sample mean was greater than 45 seconds simply because
of random chance.

.. admonition:: Questions:

    1. Was a sample mean of 55.05 seconds likely to occur by chance if the
       true population mean is actually 45 seconds? What does this imply
       about the research question?

    2. Give an approximate p-value based on this simulation study.
