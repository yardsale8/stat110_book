THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE SAMPLE MEAN
-----------------------------------

The sample mean is a random quantity; that is, it changes from sample to
sample. Therefore, the sample mean actually has its own distribution.
This distribution will tell us two things:

1. What values the sample mean can assume.

2. How often it will assume these values.

This distribution is referred to as the *distribution of the sample
mean*. An understanding of this distribution allows us to make decisions
about a population mean for a single numerical variable.

Exploring the Distribution of the Sample Mean
---------------------------------------------

Before we discuss the procedure for inference, letâ€™s consider the next
example to gain a better understanding of how the distribution of sample
means works and how we use this distribution to make a decision
concerning our research question.
