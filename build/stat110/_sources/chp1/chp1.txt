Chapter 1
=========

In the *“Evaluating a Claim of Hearing Loss”* activity, we encountered
several basic examples that required us to think statistically in order
to investigate a question of interest. Before we move on to slightly
more complex examples, we will discuss some basic definitions that will
be used throughout the semester.

In class, we conducted some simulations to identity the effect on two forms of
randomization, *randomized selection of individual units* and *random assignment
of treatments* in an experiment.  Based on these activities, we identified two
main effects of randomization.

.. admonition:: The effect of random selection of individuals in sampling

    Using a random sampling technique to select individuals resulted in
    **unbiased estimates** of parameters.  In other words, our statistics did not
    tend to over- or under-estimate the parameter, but balanced these errors
    instead.  (This assumes no other source of bias.)

.. admonition:: The effect of using random assignment of treatments in an experiment.

    Using random assignment of treatments tended to balance out other factors
    between the groups.  Therefore, other factors are not a likely cause of the
    differences between the groups and the most likely cause of any difference
    in the groups is the differences in treatments.
    
When evaluating a statistical study, the first thing that should be considered
is the *appropriate scope of the conclusions*, that is to say the types of
conclusions that are justified for this type of study.  The following table
gives some advice on what conclusions can be drawn based on

    1. Whether or not there was random sampling.
    2. Whether or not it was an experiment with random assignment of treatments.

.. admonition:: A study on flossing and gum disease (experiment)

    A recent study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of flossing on
    gum disease.  A group of 500 volunteers were randomly split into two groups.
    The first group was asked to floss once a day and the second group was asked
    to floss after each meal.  Suppose that the group that flossed after every
    meal was much less likely to have gum disease as the group that flossed
    once per day.

    .. mchoice:: mc_evaluate_3
        :answer_a: Yes
        :answer_b: No
        :correct: a
        :feedback_b: Note that the text mentions that the participants were randomly split into groups.

        Did this study use random assignment of treatments?

    .. mchoice:: mc_evaluate_4
        :answer_a: Yes, the treatments are the only *likely* explanation for the differences.
        :answer_b: No, other factors are likely to have contributed to the difference.
        :correct: a
        :feedback_a: Random assignment of the treatments will likely balance all other factors leading to gum disease.
        :feedback_b: Consider the effect of randomly assigning the flossing treatments on the other likely factors.

        Based on the fact that there was a large difference between the groups, is 
        it safe to say that the difference in flossing frequency was the most likely 
        cause of these differences?

.. admonition:: Another study on flossing and gum disease (observational study)

    In another study on flossing and gum disease, a random sample of 500 people
    were surveyed on their flossing habits and whether or not they suffered from
    gum disease.  Suppose that it was estimated that the people that flossed 
    after every meal was much less likely to have gum disease as the group 
    that flossed once per day.

    .. mchoice:: mc_evaluate_7
        :answer_a: Yes
        :answer_b: No
        :correct: b
        :feedback_a: Note that the participants were not randomly assigned a flossing treatment, but were able to decide on their own flossing habits.

        Did this study use random assignment of treatments?

    .. mchoice:: mc_evaluate_8
        :answer_a: Yes, the differences in flossing habits of the participants are the only *likely* explanation for the differences.
        :answer_b: No, other factors are likely to have contributed to the difference.
        :correct: b
        :feedback_a: The lack of random assignment of the treatments gives us no protection against other factors (like genetics) that effect gum disease.
        :feedback_b: The lack of random assignment of the treatments gives us no protection against other factors (like genetics) that effect gum disease.

        Based on the fact that there was a large difference between the groups, is 
        it safe to say that the difference in flossing frequency was the most likely 
        cause of these differences?
