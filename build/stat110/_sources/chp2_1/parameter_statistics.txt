        Parameter
            A **parameter** is a numerical descriptive measure of a population. This value is almost always unknown, and our goal in a statistical investigation is typically to either estimate this parameter or test a claim regarding it.

        Statistic
            A **statistic** is a numerical descriptive measure of a sample. This value is calculated from the observed data.
