    :correct: b
    :feedback_a: Remember that the upper p-value is the percent AT or above the value.
    :feedback_b: This is an upper tail test, so the upper p-value is the fraction of the data that is at 14 (1 out of 1000) and above 14 (0 out of 1000). 
    :feedback_c: This is an upper-tail test, use a upper p-value.
    :feedback_d: This is an upper-tail test, use a upper p-value.

    Estimate the p-value using the simulation pictured above.

    :answer_a: There is strong evidence supporting the claim that the proportion of the ten-month-old infants tend to prefer the helper toy over the hinderer toy is greater than 50%.
    :answer_b: There is not enough evidence to claim that the proportion of the ten-month-old infants tend to prefer the helper toy over the hinderer toy is greater than 50%.
    :answer_c: There is strong evidence supporting the claim that the proportion of the ten-month-old infants tend to prefer the helper toy over the hinderer toy is equal to 50%.
    :correct: a
    :feedback_a: Since the p-value = 1/1000 = 0.001 < 0.05, we have strong evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis.
    :feedback_b: A small p-value is always strong evidence in favor of the alternative.
    :feedback_c: We never have strong evidence FOR the null hypothesis, only AGAINST the null and for the alternative.

    Based on the p-value from the last question, what is the correct conclusion?

    :answer_b: 121/1000
    :answer_c: 879/1000
    :answer_d: 944/1000
    :correct: b
    :feedback_a: Remember that the lower p-value is the percent AT or below the value.
    :feedback_b: This is a lower tail test, so the lower p-value is the fraction at 9 (65 out of 1000) or below 9 (56 out of 1000).
    :feedback_c: This is an lower-tail test, use a lower p-value.
    :feedback_d: This is an lower-tail test, use a lower p-value.

    Estimate the p-value using the simulation pictured above.

.. mchoice:: conclusion_questions_2
    :answer_a: There is strong evidence supporting the claim that the proportion of women selected is less than 60%.
    :answer_b: There is not enough evidence to claim that the proportion of women selected is less than 60%.
    :answer_c: There is strong evidence supporting the claim that the proportion of women selected is equal to 60%.
    :correct: b
    :feedback_a: A large p-value never strong evidence in favor of the alternative.
    :feedback_b: The p-value = 121/1000 = 0.121 > 0.05, so we do not have strong evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis.  
    :feedback_c: We never have strong evidence FOR the null hypothesis, only AGAINST the null and for the alternative.

    Based on the p-value from the last question, what is the correct conclusion?

    :answer_a: 0/1000
    :answer_b: 1000/1000
    :correct: a
    :feedback_a: The upper p-value is twice the percent of data at or in the direction of the closest tail.
    :feedback_b: The upper p-value is twice the percent of data at or in the direction of the closest tail.

    Estimate the p-value using the simulation pictured above.

    :answer_a: There is strong evidence supporting the claim that the proportion of all consumers that select the Signet font is different than 50%
    :answer_b: There is not enough evidence to claim that the proportion of all consumers that select the Signet font is different than 50%
    :answer_c: There is strong evidence supporting the claim that the proportion of all consumers that select the Signet font is equal to than 50%
    :correct: a
    :feedback_a: This is a two-tail test, so the p-value = 2*0 = 0 < 0.05, so there is strong evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis. In this case, we measure toward the upper tail, then double the value.  
    :feedback_b: A small p-value is always strong evidence in favor of the alternative.
    :feedback_c: We never have strong evidence FOR the null hypothesis, only AGAINST the null and for the alternative.
