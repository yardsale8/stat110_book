In March of 2003, the Pew Internet & American Life Project
commissioned Princeton Survey Research Associates to develop and carry
out a survey of what Americans thought about the recent war in Iraq.
Some of the results of this survey of over 1,400 American adults are
given in the JMP data file **IraqWar.JMP**. (*Source:* *McClave &
Sincich, Problem 13.33*)
Responses to the following questions were recorded:

1. Do you support or oppose the Iraq War?

2. Do you ever go online to access the Internet or World Wide Web?

3. Do you consider yourself a Republican, Democrat, or Independent?

4. In general, would you describe your political views as very
   conservative, conservative, moderate, liberal, or very liberal?

5. What is your race?

6. Do you live in a suburban, rural, or urban community?
