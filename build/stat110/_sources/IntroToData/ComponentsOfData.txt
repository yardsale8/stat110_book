The Components of Data
======================

What is data?  To answer this question, we will first focus on an individual
piece of data and then think about a collection of data.  Please watch
the video of the corresponding lecture on this material

Understanding Data Individually
-------------------------------

Data consists of a **measurement** taken on **something**.  In statistics, we
call the measurement a *variable* and the item being measured an *individual* or
*unit*.

.. glossary::
    Individual or Unit
        The object or person being measured.  
    Variable
        The specific measurement that is being taken on an individual.

.. note::

    When determining the **variable** related to a study, it is helpful to
    think of the question that we would ask about the individual.

Here are some examples of data from my own life

    * I rated the last movie I streamed online as 3 stars (out of 5 stars).
    * My current phone has 64 GB of flash memory.
    * This morning I consumed two 20 oz. glasses of iced tea.

In each case, we can think of the description as a measurement on some
individual unit.

.. TODO: Switch these to drag and drop when it is fixed.

.. admonition:: Check your understanding - Individuals

    **Identify the individuals (What is the unit being measured?)**

    .. mchoice::     data_mc1
        :answer_a:   A movie I streamed online
        :answer_b:   My rating of a streamed movie
        :answer_c:   3 stars (out of 5 stars)
        :answer_d:   The average rating of all movies I have streamed
        :correct:    a
        :feedback_a: When discussing a movie rating, the unit being measured is a movie
        :feedback_b: This is a good description of the amount being measured.  Who/what is being measured?
        :feedback_c: You have identified <i>what</i> is measured, not <i>who</i>
        :feedback_d: This answer is related to a <i>collection</i> of data

        I rated the last movie I streamed online as 3 stars (out of 5 stars).
        Identify the individual.


    .. mchoice::     data_mc2
        :answer_a:   64 GB of flash storage
        :answer_b:   My phone
        :answer_c:   The amount of memory in my current phone
        :correct:    b
        :feedback_a: This is measurement taken, not the thing being measured
        :feedback_b: The amount of memory is a measurement on a phone
        :feedback_c: This is a good description of the amount being measured.  Who/what is being measured?

        My current phone has 64 GB of flash memory.
        Identify the individual.

    .. caution::

        While it might be possible to think of the individual here as *me* and not
        *my phone*, there could be problems with this designation.  For example,
        what if I own two phones.  We need to be very careful and specific when
        defining an individual.

    .. mchoice::     data_mc3
        :answer_a:   Amount of iced tea consumed in a morning.
        :answer_b:   two 20oz. glasses
        :answer_c:   A morning
        :answer_d:   20 ounces 
        :correct: c
        :feedback_a: This is a good description of what is being measure. Who/what is being measured?
        :feedback_b: This is the specific value of a measurement.  Who/what is being measured?
        :feedback_c: But we should be more specific.  Perhaps a weekend morning in August would be more specific.
        :feedback_d: This is the unit of measurement. Who/what is being measured?


        This morning I consumed two 20 oz. glasses of iced tea.
        Identify the individual.

.. tip::

    When describing the individual units in a study, be a specific as possible.


.. admonition:: Check your understanding - Variables

    **Identify the variable (What quality/quantity is being measured about the unit?)**

    .. mchoice::     data_mc1
        :answer_a:   A movie I streamed online
        :answer_b:   My rating of a streamed movie
        :answer_c:   3 stars (out of 5 stars)
        :answer_d:   The average rating of all movies I have streamed
        :correct:    b
        :feedback_a: When discussing a movie rating, the unit being measured is a movie, give a general description of the quality/quantity being measured.
        :feedback_b: This is a good description of the amount being measured. 
        :feedback_c: You have identified the specific value of this measurement.  Give a general description of the quality/quantity being measured.
        :feedback_d: This answer is related to a <i>collection</i> of data

        I rated the last movie I streamed online as 3 stars (out of 5 stars).
        Identify the variable.


    .. mchoice::     data_mc2
        :answer_a:   64 GB of flash storage
        :answer_b:   My phone
        :answer_c:   The amount of memory in my current phone
        :correct:    c
        :feedback_a: You have identified the specific value of this measurement.  Give a general description of the quality/quantity being measured.
        :feedback_b: The amount of memory is a measurement on a phone, making the phone the individual/unit.  Give a general description of the quality/quantity being measured.
        :feedback_c: This is a good description of the amount being measured.

        My current phone has 64 GB of flash memory. 
        Identify the variable.

    .. caution::

        While it might be possible to think of the individual here as *me* and not
        *my phone*, there could be problems with this designation.  For example,
        what if I own two phones.  We need to be very careful and specific when
        defining an individual.

        :feedback_d: This is the unit of measurement. Who/what is being measured?


        This morning I consumed two 20 oz. glasses of iced tea. 
        Identify the variable.


Understanding Data Collectively
-------------------------------

Really do we analyze one piece of data, instead we use a collection of data to
make our conclusions.  In particular, we identify two important collections of
individuals.

.. glossary:: 

    Population
        All of the individuals of interest.  This is the group that we would
        collect data on if time/money were no concern.  Typically it is
        impossible to collect data on the entire population.

    Sample
        A sample is a subset of a population and is much more managable to
        obtain.  In statistics we use samples to make guesses about populations.

A very important idea in statistics is the following

.. admonition:: Important Point

    The type of conclusions that we can draw depend on 
    
    1. The type of collection we have
    2. The manner in which the collection was calculated.

If our data collection constitutes a sample, **bias** is our primary concern 
and **the only way to ensure unbiased guesses is to use random sampling.** 
If, on the other hand,  we have the entire population, then we don't need to 
worry about *guesses* being biased based on selection, but we still need to 
worry about other forms of bias (more on this later).

Summarizing Data
----------------

One we have acquired data, we typically summarize the data on one or more of 
the following ways.

1. Create graphs
2. Compute numerical summaries

When we talk about numerical summaries of data, like the average or median
value, we make a distinction between summaries that come from a sample (thought
of as a guess) and numerical summaries that come from a population (thought of
as the exact value).

.. glossary::

    Parameter
        A number that summarizes a **population**.
    Statistic
        A number that summarizes a **sample**.

One of our first tasks will be to read a story about data and identify each of
the important components.  These include

1. The individuals/units
2. The variable(s)
3. The type of collection
4. The summary method(s)

.. caution::

    Be careful about confusing the summary method with the variable.  The
    variable describes what we collect **individually** and the summary method
    is how we **combine the data** into one number.


.. admonition:: Determine if the given summary method is a *parameter* or *statistic*.

   .. mchoice:: mc_parastat_1
        :answer_a: Parameter
        :answer_b: Statistic
        :correct: b

        In a survey of 318 Winona State students, it was found that 53.8% of the
        students selected a PC for their laptop.

   .. mchoice:: mc_parastat_2
        :answer_a: Parameter
        :answer_b: Statistic
        :correct: a

        The average salary of all 50 United States governors in 2015 was
        $135,000.

Types of Variables
------------------

There are two main types of data that are very different from each other.
First, we have *quantitative* data.  Based on the fact that the root of quantitative is
quantity, you might not be surprised at the definition of quantitative data.

.. glossary::
    Quantitative Data
        Data that is
        1. numerical
        2. Represents a quantity of something
        (Technically, we need a quantity measured in some form of standard unit, 
        like inches or kilograms)

The important thing about quantitative data is that most arithmetic on this type
of data is meaningful.  

.. admonition:: Example 1 - Height
    The height of a person is *quantitative* because, 1) it is numerical and 2) it
    represents a quantity (say in inches).  The difference between my height and the
    height of my wife is 9 inches.  Those subtracting these two values gave you some
    meaningful information.

On the other hand, there is some data that is numerical but not quantitative.
In this case, subtracting two values does not give meaningful information.

.. admonition:: Example 2 - Jersey number
    An example of data that is numerical, but not quantitative is the number on
    a football players jersey.  Clay Matthews and Aaron Rodgers are wear numbers 
    52 and 12, respectively.  The fact that the difference between there numbers 
    is 40 isn't very meaningful.
    meaningful

All data that is not quantitative is called either *categorical* or
*qualitative*.

.. glossary::
    Categorical Data
       Data that is not quantitative.  Instead that data can be broken into a
       number of categories or labeled qroups.

.. admonition:: Determine if each variable is *quantitative* or *categorical*.

    .. mchoice:: mc_type_1
        :answer_a: Quantitative
        :answer_b: Categorical
        :correct: a
        :feedback_a: This variable is bother numerical and represents a quanity in GB
        :feedback_b: Think of an example value.  Ask yourself (1) is it numerical and (2) does it represent a quantity.

         The amount of flash memory in a smartphone.


    .. mchoice:: mc_type_2
        :answer_a: Quantitative
        :answer_b: Categorical
        :correct: b
        :feedback_a: Think of an example value.  Ask yourself (1) is it numerical and (2) does it represent a quantity.
        :feedback_b: This variable is not numeric 

         The color of a smart phone.

Sources of Bias
---------------

In the first activity, we observed that hand selecting our samples lead to
*bias*, which is defined as follows.

.. glossary::
    Bias
        The tendency to over- or under-estimate the value of a parameter over
        many sample estimates.

There are three main sources of bias in discussed below.

.. glossary::
    Sample Bias
        The tendency to select some values more than others.  The best (only) method of
        combating this form of bias is *using random sampling*.
    Nonresponse Bias
        When performing a survey of people, we typically get a very small
        percent of people responding.  Furthermore, people with strong opinions
        or interest in the topic are more likely to respond, which can lead to
        biased estimates.
    Response Bias
       This form of bias occurs when the participants answers do not match the
       true feelings of the participants.  This can happen when, for example, a
       survey consists of *leading questions*.

.. note::
    The most important point here is that we prefer random samples, as they
    guarantee unbiased samples (in terms of sampling bias).

There are two main types of studies that we will be considering this semester,
*observational studies* and *experiments*.

.. glossary::
    Observational Study
       A study in which no variable is manipulated or affected by the researcher
       and instead the variables are observed in their natural state.
    Experiment
        A study where some of the variables (called explanatory variables) are
        controlled and manipulated by the researcher and the effect of these
        changes is measured on another variable (called the response variable).
    Explanatory Variable
        A variable that we think might cause a change in another variable
        (called the *response variable*).  In an experiment, the research will
        control and manipulate the response variable.
    Response Variable
        A variable that is not manipulated in any way.  We are looking for an
        effect that the explanatory variable might have on the response
