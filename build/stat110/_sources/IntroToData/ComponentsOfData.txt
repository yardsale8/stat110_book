The Components of Data
======================

What is data?  To answer this question, we will first focus on an individual
piece of data and then think about a collection of data.  Please watch

Understanding Data Individually
-------------------------------

Data consists of a **measurement** taken on **something**.  In statistics, we
call the measurement a *variable* and the item being measured an *individual* or
*unit*.

.. glossary::
    Individual or Unit
        The object or person being measured.  
    Variable
        The specific measurement that is being taken on an individual.

.. note::

    When determining the **variable** related to a study, it is helpful to
    think of the question that we would ask about the individual.

Here are some examples of data from my own life

    * I rated the last movie I streamed online as 3 stars (out of 5 stars).
    * My current phone has 64 GB of flash memory.
    * This morning I consumed two 20 oz glasses of iced tea.

In each case, we can think of the description as a measurement on some
individual unit.

.. TODO: Switch these to drag and drop when it is fixed.

.. TODO: Add an example with a poor variable description like "shoes" instead of
..       "whether or not ..."

.. admonition:: Check your understanding - Individuals

    **Identify the individuals (What is the unit being measured?)**

    .. mchoice::     data_mc1
        :answer_a:   A movie I streamed online
        :answer_b:   My rating of a streamed movie
        :answer_c:   3 stars (out of 5 stars)
        :answer_d:   The average rating of all movies I have streamed
        :correct:    a
        :feedback_a: When discussing a movie rating, the unit being measured is a movie
        :feedback_b: This is a good description of the amount being measured.  Who/what is being measured?
        :feedback_c: You have identified <i>what</i> is measured, not <i>who</i>
        :feedback_d: This answer is related to a <i>collection</i> of data

        I rated the last movie I streamed online as 3 stars (out of 5 stars).
        Identify the individual.


    .. mchoice::     data_mc2
        :answer_a:   64 GB of flash storage
        :answer_b:   My phone
        :answer_c:   The amount of memory in my current phone
        :correct:    b
        :feedback_a: This is measurement taken, not the thing being measured
        :feedback_b: The amount of memory is a measurement on a phone
        :feedback_c: This is a good description of the amount being measured.  Who/what is being measured?

        My current phone has 64 GB of flash memory.
        Identify the individual.

    .. caution::

        While it might be possible to think of the individual here as *me* and not
        *my phone*, there could be problems with this designation.  For example,
        what if I own two phones?  We need to be very careful and specific when
        defining an individual.

    .. mchoice::     data_mc3
        :answer_a:   Amount of iced tea consumed in a morning.
        :answer_b:   two 20oz. glasses
        :answer_c:   A morning
        :answer_d:   20 ounces 
        :correct: c
        :feedback_a: This is a good description of what is being measure. Who/what is being measured?
        :feedback_b: This is the specific value of a measurement.  Who/what is being measured?
        :feedback_c: But we should be more specific.  Perhaps a weekend morning in August would be more specific.
        :feedback_d: This is the unit of measurement. Who/what is being measured?


        This morning I consumed two 20 oz. glasses of iced tea.
        Identify the individual.

.. tip::

    When describing the individual units in a study, be a specific as possible.

        Identify the variable.


Understanding Data Collectively
-------------------------------

Really do we analyze one piece of data, instead we use a collection of data to
make our conclusions.  In particular, we identify two important collections of
individuals.

.. glossary:: 

    Population
        All of the individuals of interest.  This is the group that we would
        collect data on if time/money were no concern.  Typically it is
        impossible to collect data on the entire population.

    Sample
        A sample is a subset of a population and is much more manageable to
        obtain.  In statistics we use samples to make guesses about populations.

A very important idea in statistics is the following

.. admonition:: Important Point

    The type of conclusions that we can draw depend on 
    
    1. The type of collection we have
    2. The manner in which the collection was calculated.

If our data collection constitutes a sample, **bias** is our primary concern 
and **the only way to ensure unbiased guesses is to use random sampling.** 
If, on the other hand,  we have the entire population, then we don't need to 
worry about *guesses* being biased based on selection, but we still need to 
worry about other forms of bias (more on this later).

Summarizing Data
----------------

One we have acquired data, we typically summarize the data on one or more of 
the following ways.

1. Create graphs
2. Compute numerical summaries

When we talk about numerical summaries of data, like the average or median
value, we make a distinction between summaries that come from a sample (thought
of as a guess) and numerical summaries that come from a population (thought of
as the exact value).

.. glossary::

    Parameter
        A number that summarizes a **population**.
    Statistic
        A number that summarizes a **sample**.

One of our first tasks will be to read a story about data and identify each of
the important components.  These include

1. The individuals/units
2. The variable(s)
3. The type of collection
4. The summary method(s)

.. caution::

    Be careful about confusing the summary method with the variable.  The
    variable describes what we collect **individually** and the summary method
    is how we **combine the data** into one number.


.. admonition:: Determine if the given summary method is a *parameter* or *statistic*.

   .. mchoice:: mc_parastat_1
        :answer_a: Parameter
        :answer_b: Statistic
        :correct: b

        In a survey of 318 Winona State students, it was found that 53.8% of the
        students selected a PC for their laptop.

   .. mchoice:: mc_parastat_2
        :answer_a: Parameter
        :answer_b: Statistic
        :correct: a

        The average salary of all 50 United States governors in 2015 was
        $135,000.

Types of Variables
------------------

There are two main types of data that are very different from each other.
First, we have *quantitative* data.  Based on the fact that the root of quantitative is
quantity, you might not be surprised at the definition of quantitative data.

.. glossary::
    Quantitative Data
        Data that is
        1. numerical
        2. Represents a quantity of something
        (Technically, we need a quantity measured in some form of standard unit, 
        like inches or kilograms)

The important thing about quantitative data is that most arithmetic on this type
of data is meaningful.  

.. admonition:: Example 1 - Height
    The height of a person is *quantitative* because, 1) it is numerical and 2) it
    represents a quantity (say in inches).  The difference between my height and the
    height of my wife is 9 inches.  Those subtracting these two values gave you some
    meaningful information.

On the other hand, there is some data that is numerical but not quantitative.
In this case, subtracting two values does not give meaningful information.

.. admonition:: Example 2 - Jersey number
    An example of data that is numerical, but not quantitative is the number on
    a football player's jersey.  Clay Matthews and Aaron Rodgers are wear numbers 
    52 and 12, respectively.  The fact that the difference between their numbers 
    is 40 isn't very meaningful.
    meaningful

All data that is not quantitative is called either *categorical* or
*qualitative*.

.. glossary::
    Categorical Data
       Data that is not quantitative.  Instead that data can be broken into a
       number of categories or labeled groups.

.. admonition:: Determine if each variable is *quantitative* or *categorical*.

    .. mchoice:: mc_type_1
        :answer_a: Quantitative
        :answer_b: Categorical
        :correct: a
        :feedback_a: This variable is bother numerical and represents a quantity in GB
        :feedback_b: Think of an example value.  Ask yourself (1) is it numerical and (2) does it represent a quantity.

         The amount of flash memory in a smartphone.


    .. mchoice:: mc_type_2
        :answer_a: Quantitative
        :answer_b: Categorical
        :correct: b
        :feedback_a: Think of an example value.  Ask yourself (1) is it numerical and (2) does it represent a quantity.
        :feedback_b: This variable is not numeric 

         The color of a smart phone.

In the first activity, we observed that hand selecting our samples lead to
*bias*, which is defined as follows.

.. glossary::
    Bias
        The tendency to over- or under-estimate the value of a parameter over
        many sample estimates.

There are three main sources of bias in discussed below.

.. glossary::
    Sample Bias
        The tendency to select some values more than others.  The best (only) method of
        combating this form of bias is *using random sampling*.
    Nonresponse Bias
        When performing a survey of people, we typically get a very small
        percent of people responding.  Furthermore, people with strong opinions
        or interest in the topic are more likely to respond, which can lead to
        biased estimates.
    Response Bias
       This form of bias occurs when the participants answers do not match the
       true feelings of the participants.  This can happen when, for example, a
       survey consists of *leading questions*.

.. note::
    The most important point here is that we prefer random samples, as they
    guarantee unbiased samples (in terms of sampling bias).

.. mchoice:: mc_bias_1
    :answer_a: Sampling Bias
    :answer_b: Non-response Bias
    :answer_c: Response Bias
    :correct: a
    :feedback_a: The survey only collected data on readers of *Literary Digest*, leading to other segments of the population being under-represented.
    :feedback_b: With more than 2.4 million people responding, non-response wouldn't be an issue.
    :feedback_c: There is nothing in the problem to suggest a problem with response bias (such as leading questions etc.)

    In 1936, *Literary Digest* magazine conducted a survey of their readers, 
    asking their readers if they would vote for Roosevelt or Landon.  More than
    2.4 million people responded, and more than 57% responded that they would
    vote for Landon.  In the actual election, Roosevelt won by a landslide,
    earning more than 63% of the popular vote.  Determine the source of bias in
    this sampling procedure.

There are two main types of studies that we will be considering this semester,
*observational studies* and *experiments*.

.. glossary::
    Observational Study
       A study in which no variable is manipulated or affected by the researcher
       and instead the variables are observed in their natural state.
    Experiment
        A study where some of the variables (called explanatory variables) are
        controlled and manipulated by the researcher and the effect of these
        changes is measured on another variable (called the response variable).
    Explanatory Variable
        A variable that we think might cause a change in another variable
        (called the *response variable*).  In an experiment, the research will
        control and manipulate the response variable.
    Response Variable
        A variable that is not manipulated in any way.  We are looking for an
        effect that the explanatory variable might have on the response

In class, we conducted some simulations to identity the effect on two forms of
randomization, *randomized selection of individual units* and *random assignment
of treatments* in an experiment.  Based on these activities in class, we 
identified two main effects of randomization.

.. admonition:: The effect of random selection of individuals in sampling

    Using a random sampling technique to select individuals resulted in
    **unbiased estimates** of parameters.  In other words, our statistics did not
    tend to over- or under-estimate the parameter, but balanced these errors
    instead.

.. admonition:: The effect of using random assignment of treatments in an experiment.

    Using random assignment of treatments tended to balance out other factors
    between the groups.  Therefore, other factors are not a likely cause of the
    differences between the groups and the most likely cause of any difference
    in the groups is the differences in treatments.
    
When evaluating a statistical study, the first thing that should be considered
is the *appropriate scope of the conclusions*, that is to say the types of
conclusions that are justified for this type of study.  The following table
gives some advice on what conclusions can be drawn based on

    1. Whether or not there was random sampling.
    2. Whether of not it was an experiment with random assignment of treatments.

.. admonition:: A study on flossing and gum disease (experiment)

    A recent study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of flossing on
    gum disease.  A group of 500 volunteers were randomly split into two groups.
    The first group was asked to floss once a day and the second group was asked
    to floss after each meal.  Suppose that the group that flossed after every
    meal was much less likely to have gum disease as the group that flossed
    once per day.

    .. mchoice:: mc_evaluate_1
        :answer_a: Yes
        :answer_b: No
        :correct: b
        :feedback_a: Note that the description mentioned that the participants were volunteers.
        :feedback_b: The participants volunteered and were not randomly selected.

        Did this study use random sampling?

    .. mchoice:: mc_evaluate_2
        :answer_a: Yes, the effects the flossing treatments would be the same for the general population.
        :answer_b: No, there is a danger that our estimates of the effects of flossing on gum disease is likely biased.
        :correct: b
        :feedback_a: The participants in the study were volunteers and not a randomly selected sample.
        :feedback_b: The lack of a randomly selected sample means that we are in danger of biased estimates.

        Is it safe to generalize the results of this study?

        Did this study use random assignment of treatments?

    .. mchoice:: mc_evaluate_4
        :answer_a: Yes, the treatments are the only *likely* explanation for the differences.
        :answer_b: No, other factors are likely to have contributed to the difference.
        :correct: a
        :feedback_a: Random assignment of the treatments will likely balance all other factors leading to gum disease.
        :feedback_b: Consider the effect of randomly assigning the flossing treatments on the other likely factors.

        Based on the fact that there was a large difference between the groups, is 
        it safe to say that the difference in flossing frequency was the most likely 
        cause of these differences?

.. admonition:: Another study on flossing and gum disease (observational study)

    In another study on flossing and gum disease, a random sample of 500 people
    were surveyed on their flossing habits and whether or not they suffered from
    gum disease.  Suppose that it was estimated that the people that flossed 
    after every meal was much less likely to have gum disease as the group 
    that flossed once per day.

    .. mchoice:: mc_evaluate_5
        :answer_a: Yes
        :answer_b: No
        :correct: a
        :feedback_b: The text explicitly mentioned a random sample.

        Did this study use random sampling?

    .. mchoice:: mc_evaluate_6
        :answer_a: Yes, the effects the flossing treatments will be the same for the general population.
        :answer_b: No, there is a danger that our estimates of the effects of flossing on gum disease is likely biased.
        :correct: a
        :feedback_a: Because we are taking a random sample, our statistics should be unbiased and not over- or under-estimate the rates of gum disease in each group.
        :feedback_b: What is the effect of random sampling on bias and a statistics ability to estimate a parameter?

        Is it safe to generalize the results of this study?

        :answer_a: Yes
        :answer_b: No
        :correct: b
        :feedback_a: Note that the participants were not randomly assigned a flossing treatment, but were able to decide on their own flossing habits.

        Did this study use random assignment of treatments?

        :answer_a: Yes, the differences in flossing habits of the participants are the only *likely* explanation for the differences.
        :answer_b: No, other factors are likely to have contributed to the difference.
        :correct: b
        :feedback_a: The lack of random assignment of the treatments gives us no protection against other factors (like genetics) that effect gum disease.
        :feedback_b: The lack of random assignment of the treatments gives us no protection against other factors (like genetics) that effect gum disease.

        Based on the fact that there was a large difference between the groups, is 
        it safe to say that the difference in flossing frequency was the most likely 
        cause of these differences?
