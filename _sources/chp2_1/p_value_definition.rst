        p-value
            A *p-value* is the probability of observing an outcome as extreme (or even more extreme in favor of the research hypothesis) than the observed study result, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

Note that in each of the above examples, we obtained the simulation
results assuming the null hypothesis was true. Therefore, to *estimate*
the p-value, we simply determine how often outcomes as extreme (or even
more extreme) than the observed study results appeared in our simulation
study.
