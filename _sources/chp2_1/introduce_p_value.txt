Evaluating Evidence Using P-Values
----------------------------------

In in each of our three examples, we essentially *assumed the null
hypothesis was true* when setting up our spinner for the Tinkerplots
investigation. Then, we used the results simulated under this scenario
to help us decide whether observing results such as our sample data
would be an unusual event if the null hypothesis were true.

Up to this point, whether an observed study result was considered
unusual (or extreme) has been a rather subjective decision. Now, we will
discuss the guidelines used by statisticians to determine whether an
observed study result is extreme enough under the null hypothesis for us
to conclude that the evidence supports the research hypothesis.

First, note that in our three examples, we examined different parts of
the distribution of simulated outcomes when deciding whether the
observed study data was extreme. Each of these cases is an example of a
specific type of hypothesis test.

Statisticians typically use the following guidelines to determine
whether the observed data supports the research question:

Statisticians use what is called a **p-value** to quantify the amount
of evidence that an observed outcome from a set of data provides for a
research question.
