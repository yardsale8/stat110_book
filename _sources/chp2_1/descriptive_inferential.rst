        Descriptive statistics
            **Decriptive statistics** are methods that describe, show, or summarize the data from our sample in a meaningful way.
        Inferential statistics 
            **Inferential statistics** are methods that allow us to draw conclusions about the larger population that the sample represents.

.. admonition:: Question

    For example, recall the Helper vs. Hinder study from Example 1.2. In the
    sample of 16 infants studied, 14 of the 16 picked the helper. What
    descriptive methods might we use to *describe* the results of this
    study?
