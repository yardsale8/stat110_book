Example 2.2: Effectiveness of an Experimental Drug
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Suppose a commonly prescribed drug for relieving nervous tension is
believed to be only 70% effective. Experimental results with a *new*
drug administered to a random sample of 20 adults who were suffering
from nervous tension show that 18 received relief. Is there statistical
evidence that the new experimental drug is more than 70% effective?
