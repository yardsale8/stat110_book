Practical Significance versus Statistical Significance
------------------------------------------------------

Consider the previous example. As discussed earlier, the result in Study #1 is
not “statistically significant” because the observed outcome does not fall in
the bottom 5% of simulated outcomes (i.e., the p-value is not below .05). On the
contrary, the results in Study #2 and Study #3 are “statistically significant.”
The previous example illustrates that statistical significance depends on the
sample size.

All three studies resulted in an outcome of 45% of those selected for management
being female, but this result was only statistically significant in the studies
with the larger sample size.  This presents a conundrum: If a study’s results
are not statistically significant, it could be that the effect under study is
real, but the sample size wasn’t large enough to detect that effect (this
relates to a concept known as the *power* of a hypothesis test which is
discussed in upper-level statistics courses). On the other hand, if the sample
size is large enough, very small differences between the observed results and
the expected value in the null hypothesis can lead to statistically significant
differences.

To counter this, researchers often consider “practical significance” in addition
to “statistical significance.” A result is known as “practically significant” if
the difference between the observed and expected result is large enough to be of
value in the practical sense.

Example 2.4: Dukes vs. Wal-mart Stores, Inc.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The lead plaintiff in this case, Betty Dukes, was a Wal-Mart employee.
She and others alleged gender discrimination in promotion policies and
practices in Wal-Mart stores.

As the nation’s largest private employer, Wal-Mart makes tens of
thousands of promotion decisions each year. The following data was
provided during this trial: Wal-Mart promoted roughly 50,000 individuals
to management between 1997 and 2002. Female employees constituted about
60% of the group eligible for these promotions.

.. admonition:: Questions:

    1. How many of the 50,000 individuals promoted do you expect to be
       female if Wal-Mart is not discriminating based on gender?

    2. Suppose that 29,780 of the individuals promoted were women (note that
       this was not the actual outcome in the court case). What percentage
       is this?

    3. A simulation study with 100 trials was conducted to see what
       outcomes occur by chance when the selection process is **not**
       discriminatory. The results are shown below.

       Recall the hypothetical observed value of 29,780 females being
       selected. The research hypothesis is that Wal-Mart is
       discriminating against women in their promotion policies and
       practices. Based on the results of the simulation study, is this
       result “statistically significant”? Explain.

    4. In the previous question, you estimated the p-value for this research
       hypothesis. Use the binomial distribution to find the exact p-value.
       Again, is the result “statistically significant”?

    5. Is this result “practically significant”? Explain.

    6. Do you foresee any problems if we rely on only statistical
       significance when making decisions? Explain.
