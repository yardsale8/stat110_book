Formal Hypothesis Testing
-------------------------

You are most likely already familiar with several methods for descriptive
statistics (e.g., calculating percentages, constructing bar charts or pie
charts, etc.). Inferential methods, however, may be new to you. Again,
inferential statistics involves drawing conclusions about the larger population
that our sample was supposed to represent.  In several examples introduced in
Chapter 1, we used a logical process to make statistical decisions concerning a
population of interest – we were actually using inferential statistics already!
Now, we will add more structure to these statistical investigations by
introducing an inferential statistics procedure known as **hypothesis testing**.
Note that in this chapter, we look at hypothesis testing for only research
questions involving a single categorical variable.  Before we discuss this
procedure, however, we must introduce a few more definitions.
