The general approach used in a statistical investigation is shown in the
following diagram. Note that every investigation starts with a question
that gets converted to a research hypothesis. Though we will rarely
design our own studies in this course, we will discuss good strategies
and best practices for collecting data throughout the semester. Most of
our attention will be devoted to descriptive and inferential methods for
analyzing the data, how we decide whether the data supports the research
question, and how to write conclusions that appropriately summarize the
results of the study.

In Chapter 2, we will discuss methods for making decisions concerning
research hypotheses involving only a single categorical variable. Even
though weâ€™ll be adding lots of terminology and formalities along the
way, we will use the same logical approach to investigating research
questions that was introduced in Chapter 1.
