Next, let’s carry out a formal hypothesis test for a few new examples.

Example 2.1: Claims of Numbness after an Automobile Accident
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A 28-year-old white woman developed pain involving the spine and the
left side of her body after an automobile collision. She was actively
involved in a personal litigation against the company that owned the
other vehicle, and she reported constant pain and numbness in the left
arm. To test her claims, researchers touched her left arm with either
1 finger or 2 fingers simultaneously while her eyes were closed. The
word “touch” was said simultaneously with the presentation of the
tactile stimulus so that the subject knew when to respond. She then
had to indicate whether she felt 1 single touch or 2 simultaneous
touches (with the double-touch stimulus, the fingertips were always
spaced 2 inches apart). The subject received 100 stimuli overall; she
was correct on 30 of them. Is there statistical evidence that she is
intentionally answering incorrectly?

.. admonition:: Questions:

    1. Identify both the population and sample of interest.

    2. Identify the single categorical variable of interest.

    3. Identify both the parameter and statistic of interest.

    4. Carry out the formal hypothesis test to address the research
       question.
