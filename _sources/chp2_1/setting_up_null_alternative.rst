Setting Up the Null and Alternative Hypothesis
----------------------------------------------

-  The *null hypothesis*, H\ :sub:`o`, is what we will assume to be true
   (i.e., we will assume for the time being that whatever effect we want
   to detect doesnâ€™t exist in reality). We will then evaluate the
   observed outcome from our study against what outcomes we expected to
   see under the null hypothesis. This will always contain a statement
   saying that the population parameter is **equal** to some value.

-  The *alternative hypothesis*, H\ :sub:`a`, is what we are trying to
   show. Therefore, the research hypothesis is simply restated here as
   if it were true in the alternative hypothesis. This will always
   contain statements of inequality, saying that the population
   parameter is **less than, greater than, or different from** the value
   in the null hypothesis.

For our three examples, the null and alternative hypotheses are shown
below.

Note that we can also state these hypotheses in terms of the
population parameter of interest using formal notation:
