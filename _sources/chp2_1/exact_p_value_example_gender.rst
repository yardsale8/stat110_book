Example: Gender Discrimination
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Recall that we already estimated the probability of observing 9 or fewer
women selected out of 20 if there was no discrimination (i.e., we
estimated the p-value with a simulation study).

Estimated p-value = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Next, we will use the binomial distribution to find the exact p-value
for the Gender Discrimination Study. First, check whether the
assumptions behind the binomial distribution seem reasonable in this
case.

-  There exist a fixed number of trials, n.

-  There are only two possible outcomes on each trial (“success” or
       “failure”).

-  The probability of success (π) remains constant from trial to trial.

-  The n trials are independent.

To find the exact p-value, we will use the binomial distribution with…

**p-value:** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Conclusion:** We do not have enough evidence that the company is discriminating against females when selecting employees for management training.
