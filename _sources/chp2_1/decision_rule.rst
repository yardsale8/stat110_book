Why does this decision rule work? Consider the “Helper vs. Hinderer”
example. Because the p-value falls below 5%, the observed result
*must* have been in the upper 5% of the reference distribution. As
stated earlier, this implies that the observed study result is very
unlikely to happen by chance under the null hypothesis, which supports
the research question.

On the other hand, consider the “Are Women Passed Over for Managerial
Training” example. Because the p-value was larger than 5%, the
observed result *can’t* have been in the lower 5% of the reference
distribution. This implies that the observed study result is not all
that unusual and could have easily happened by chance under the null
hypothesis. Therefore, the null hypothesis *could* be true, and we
have no evidence to support the research question.

This decision rule is widely accepted for determining whether study
results are statistically significant; however, some researchers do
advocate using a more flexible rule similar to the following:

    -  If the p-value falls below .05, we have strong statistical evidence to support the alternative hypothesis (i.e., the research question).
    -  If the p-value falls below .10 but above .05, we have “marginal” statistical evidence to support the alternative hypothesis (i.e., the research question).
    -  If the p-value is above .10, we have no evidence to support the research question.
