    Hypothesis Testing
        *Hypothesis testing* is a procedure, based on sample evidence and
        probability, used to test a claim regarding a population parameter. The
        test will measure how well our observed sample statistic agrees with
        some assumption about this population parameter.

Before you begin a hypothesis test, you should clearly state your
research hypothesis. For instance, letâ€™s reconsider the research
hypotheses from three of our previous examples.

Once the research hypothesis has been developed, we typically
formulate what are known as the null and alternative hypotheses. The
null and alternative hypotheses are both statements about the parameter
of interest in the study.
