Next, we will review the steps involved in a formal hypothesis test for
each of our three examples. Note that our conclusions are written in the
context of the problem. Moreover, even a person with no statistical
background should be able to understand these conclusions (i.e., a
conclusion should NOT say something like “We reject the null
hypothesis.”)
