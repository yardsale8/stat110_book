Example 3.4: Alcoholism and Depression
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Past research has suggested a high rate of alcoholism in families of patients
with primary unipolar depression. A study of 210 families of females with
primary unipolar depression found that 89 had alcoholism present. A set of 299
control families found 94 present.

.. admonition:: Research Hypothesis: 

    The proportion of families afflicted by alcoholism *differs* depending on whether or not the female in the family had primary unipolar depression.

The data can be found in the file **Depression.JMP**:

.. admonition:: Questions:

    1. Identify the proportion of families with alcoholism in both groups.

    2. Is there evidence that the proportion of families afflicted by
       alcoholism *differs* depending on whether or not the female in the
       family had primary unipolar depression? Use the JMP output to answer
       this question.

    3. Can we say that a female having unipolar depression *causes*
       alcoholism in her family? Explain your reasoning.
