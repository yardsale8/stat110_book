Chi-square Test of Independence versus Chi-square Test of Homogeneity
---------------------------------------------------------------------

In the context of our Iraq War example, some statisticians might
differentiate between these two versions of the chi-square test as
follows.

Note that the choice of homogeneity versus independence depends on
only the study design and that the phrasing of the research question
is slightly different between the two versions.
The actual study described here in Example 3.11 involved a single
random sample, so this is technically a chi-square test of
independence. If the researchers had taken separate random samples of
U.S. citizens from each political affiliation group, how would our
results have changed? The answer isâ€¦ not much. We would have
calculated the chi-square test statistic in the same way, so we would
have obtained the same test statistic and the same p-value. Our
conclusion might have focused on there being a significant difference
in the proportion that supports the war across political affiliation
instead of focusing on there being a significant relationship between
the two variables, but the overall story would have remained the same.
