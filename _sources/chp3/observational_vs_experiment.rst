Observational Studies vs. Designed Experiments
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Reconsider the “Vested Interest and Task Performance” example.  Fisher’s exact
test provided evidence that the proportion of successes was in fact smaller for
the vested interest group (p-value = .0498). Now, the question is this: can we
conclude that having a vested interest really is the *cause* of the decreased
performance?

The answer to this question lies in whether the experiment itself was a
designed experiment or an observational study.

    Observational Study
        An ***observational study*** involves collecting and analyzing data *without randomly* assigning treatments to experimental units.
    Designed Experiment
        On the other hand, in a ***designed experiment***, a treatment is *randomly* imposed on individual subjects in order to observe whether the treatment causes a change in the response.

.. admonition:: Key statistical idea:

    The random assignment of treatments used by researchers in a designed
    experiment should balance out between the treatment groups any other factors
    that might be related to the response variable. Therefore, designed
    experiments *can* be used to establish a cause-and-effect relationship (as
    long as the p-value is small).

    On the other hand, observational studies establish only that an association
    exists between the predictor and response variable. With observational
    studies, it is always possible that there are other lurking variables not
    controlled for in the study that may be impacting the response. Since we
    can’t be certain these other factors are balanced out between treatment
    groups, it is possible that these other factors could explain the difference
    between treatment groups.

Note that the “Vested Interest and Task Performance” study is an example
of a designed experiment since participants were randomly assigned to
the two groups. We were trying to show that having a vested interest
*caused* a decreased task performance. The small p-value rules out
observing the decreased performance in the vested interest group simply
by chance, and the randomization of subjects to treatment groups should
have balanced out any other factors that might explain the difference.
So, the most likely explanation left is that having a vested interest
really is the cause of the decreased task performance.
