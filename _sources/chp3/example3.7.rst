Example 3.7: Adoption and Suicide Attempts
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In September of 2013, researchers from the University of Minnesota
published a study in the journal *Pediatrics.* This study was described
in a *Fox News* article titled “Adopted teens may be at higher risk of
suicide.” This article described the results as follows:

    [The researchers] examined data from an existing University of
    Minnesota study of 692 adopted children and 540 non-adopted siblings in
    Minnesota… All of the adopted kids, who were between 11 and 21 years old
    during the study period, had been taken in by their families before age
    two. Almost three quarters of the adopted children were born abroad,
    most of the foreign-born children were from `South
    Korea <http://www.reuters.com/places/south-korea>`__ and 60 percent of
    those were girls. At the beginning of the study, and again about three
    years later, the researchers asked participating families if the
    children had made a suicide attempt. Over the three years of the study,
    56 children attempted suicide at least once, according to the family
    members' reports. Of those kids, 47 were adopted and nine were not
    adopted.

.. admonition:: Questions:

    1. Create a table of counts based on the data obtained in this study:

    +---------------+-------------------+----------------------+------------+
    |               | Suicide Attempt   | No Suicide Attempt   | *Totals*   |
    +===============+===================+======================+============+
    | Adopted       |                   |                      |            |
    +---------------+-------------------+----------------------+------------+
    | Not adopted   |                   |                      |            |
    +---------------+-------------------+----------------------+------------+
    | *Totals*      |                   |                      |            |
    +---------------+-------------------+----------------------+------------+

    2. Find the proportion of adopted children that attempted suicide.

    3. Find the proportion of non-adopted children that attempted suicide.

    4. Find and interpret a 95% confidence interval for the difference in
       proportions.
