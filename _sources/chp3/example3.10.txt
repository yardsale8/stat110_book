Example 3.10: Importance of Considering Absolute Risk
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In 1995, the UK Committee on Safety of Medicines issued a warning that
birth control pills increased the risk of life-threating blood clots.
The data on which these conclusions were drawn were very similar to the
following outcomes.

+---------------------------+------------------+---------------------+--------------+
| **Birth Control Pill?**   | **Blood Clot**   | **No Blood Clot**   | **Total**    |
+===========================+==================+=====================+==============+
| Yes                       | 2                | 6998                | **7000**     |
+---------------------------+------------------+---------------------+--------------+
| No                        | 1                | 6999                | **7000**     |
+---------------------------+------------------+---------------------+--------------+
| **Total**                 | **3**            | **13,997**          | **14,000**   |

.. admonition:: Questions:

    1. Find the risk of blood clots for those using birth control pills.

    2. Find the risk of blood clots for those not using birth control pills.

    3. Find and interpret the relative risk.

    4. All of the headlines related to this study mentioned the “two-fold
       risk increase” or “100% risk increase” in blood clots because of the
       birth control pill. What do you suppose happened to the number of
       birth control users after these results were publicized? Are there
       any potential negative consequences to this? Explain.

    5. What do you suppose would have happened had patients also considered
       the absolute risk of blood clots for those using birth control pills?
