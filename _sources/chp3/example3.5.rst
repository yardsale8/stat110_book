Example 3.5: Mice and Tobacco Smoke
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Ten mice (6–8 weeks old) were randomly assigned to one of two groups;
five were exposed to simulated environmental tobacco smoke for 6 h/day,
5 days/week for 5 months. The other 5 mice were kept in clean air during
this time period. Then, all of the mice were allowed to recover for a
further 4 months in filtered air before being killed for analysis of
lung tumor incidence. The results are shown below.

.. admonition:: Research hypothesis: 

    The proportion of mice that develop a lung tumor differs between those exposed to tobacco smoke and the control group.

**Step 1: Convert the Research Hypothesis into H\ :sub:`o` and H\ :sub:`a`.**

    H\ :sub:`0`: The proportion of mice that develop a lung tumor when
    exposed to tobacco does not differ from the proportion that develop
    a lung tumor when not exposed to tobacco.

    H\ :sub:`a`: The proportion of mice that develop a lung tumor
    differs between those exposed to tobacco smoke and those not
    exposed.

    Equivalently, we can state the hypotheses as follows:

    H\ :sub:`0`:

    H\ :sub:`a`:

**Step 2: Find the p-value for the data.**

    p-value from Fisher’s exact test: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

    p-value from Chi-Square test: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

.. admonition:: Keep the assumptions behind the chi-square test in mind:

    The chi-square test for independence may be inappropriate for tables with
    very small expected cell frequencies. One rule of thumb suggests that most
    of the expected cell frequencies in the table should be 5 or more;
    otherwise, the chi-square approximation may not be reliable.

    Also, each observation in the study can be classified into only one cell of
    the contingency table, and the observations must be independent.


.. admonition:: Questions:

    1. Do the assumptions behind the chi-square test appear to be met?
       Explain.

    2. Which test should we use – Fisher’s exact or Chi-square? Explain.

**Step 3: Write a conclusion addressing the original research hypothesis.**
