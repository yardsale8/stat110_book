Calculating Risks and the Relative Risk
---------------------------------------

The confidence interval calculated above helps us to quantify the
discrepancy in the proportion of adopted versus non-adopted that had
attempted suicide. We could also measure the amount of discrepancy
between these two proportions based on something called **relative
risk**. This involves taking the *ratio* of the two proportions instead
of the *difference*.

Note that in the previous example, our estimate of the *proportion* of
adopted children that had attempted suicide could be viewed as an
estimate of the *probability* of an adopted child attempting suicide
(the same could be said for the non-adopted group). When we calculate
the probability of an adverse event, we sometimes refer to this
probability as a **risk**.

For example, we can calculate the **risk** of attempting suicide for
both groups in this study as follows:

+---------------+-------------------+----------------------+---------+
|               | Suicide Attempt   | No Suicide Attempt   | Total   |
+===============+===================+======================+=========+
| Adopted       | 47                | 645                  | 692     |
+---------------+-------------------+----------------------+---------+
| Not adopted   | 9                 | 531                  | 540     |
+---------------+-------------------+----------------------+---------+

-  Risk of attempting suicide for the Adopted group =

-  Risk of attempting suicide for the Not Adopted group =

The **relative risk** (also called the risk ratio) is then computed as
follows:

.. math:: \mathrm{Relative\,Risk} = \frac{\hat{\pi}_{\mathrm{Suicide|Adopted}}}{\hat{\pi}_{\mathrm{Suicide|Not\,Adopted}}}

.. note:: 

    1. We interpret this number by saying that in this study, the risk of
       suicide attempt for adopted children was \_\_\_\_\_\_ times as
       large as the risk of suicide attempt for children who were not
       adopted. In other words, adopted children were \_\_\_\_\_\_ times
       as likely to attempt suicide as were non-adopted children.

    2. A relative risk value of 1.0 is the reference value for making
       comparisons. That is, a relative risk of 1.0 says that there is
       no difference in the two proportions of interest.

    3. When you are interpreting a relative risk, you MUST consider which
       value you have in the numerator. For example, we could have also
       calculated the relative risk as follows:

       .. math:: \mathrm{Relative\,Risk} = \frac{\hat{\pi}_{\mathrm{Suicide|Not\,Adopted}}}{\hat{\pi}_{\mathrm{Suicide|Adopted}}}

       How would we interpret this value?
