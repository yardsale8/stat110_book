Example 3.1: MythBusters and the Yawning Experiment
---------------------------------------------------

MythBusters, a popular television program on the Discovery Channel, once
conducted an experiment to investigate whether or not yawning is
contagious. The premise of the experiment was to invite a stranger to
sit in a booth for an extended period of time. Fifty subjects were said
to be tested in total, of which 34 were "seeded" with a yawn by the
person conducting the experiment. The other 16 were not given a yawn
seed. Using a two-way mirror and a hidden camera, the experimenters
observed and recorded the results which are given below.

+--------------------------+----------+----------------+---------+
|                          | Yawned   | Did not Yawn   | Total   |
+==========================+==========+================+=========+
| Seeded with a yawn       | 10       | 24             | 34      |
+--------------------------+----------+----------------+---------+
| Not seeded with a yawn   | 4        | 12             | 16      |
+--------------------------+----------+----------------+---------+

.. admonition:: Research Hypothesis: 

   Those “seeded” with a yawn are more likely to actually yawn than those who are not seeded.
