When we analyze data on two variables, our first step is to distinguish
between the **response** variable and the **explanatory** (or
**predictor**) variable.

.. glossary::

    Response variable: 
         The **response variable** is the outcome variable on which comparisons are made.
    Explanatory (or Predictor) variable:
         The **expanatory variable** defines the groups to be compared.

.. admonition:: Questions:

    1. What variables must be measured in the MythBusters Yawning experiment
       in order to investigate the research hypothesis? Are these variables
       categorical or numerical?

    2. Which is the response variable? Which is the explanatory variable?
