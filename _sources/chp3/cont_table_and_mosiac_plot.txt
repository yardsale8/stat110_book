.. admonition:: Descriptive Methods for Two Categorical Variables:

      - A **contingency table** shows the joint frequencies of two categorical
        variables. The rows of the table denote the categories of the first
        variable, and the columns denote the categories of the second variable.

      - A **mosaic plot** gives a visual representation of the relationship
        between two categorical variables. A mosaic plot graphically presents
        the information given in the contingency table.

To obtain these descriptive summaries from JMP, the data should be
entered as follows:

|image300|

Select **Analyze > Fit Y by X**. Place the response variable in the **Y,
Response** box and the explanatory variable in the **X, Factor** box.

Click OK, and JMP returns the following:

.. admonition:: Questions:

    1. Find the proportion that yawned in the Seeded group.

    2. Find the proportion that yawned in the Not Seeded group.

    3. Find the difference in the proportion that yawned between these two
       groups. Do these proportions differ in the direction conjectured by
       the researchers?

    4. Even if the seeding of a yawn had absolutely no effect on whether or
       not a subject actually yawned, is it *possible* to have obtained a
       difference such as this by random chance alone? Explain.
