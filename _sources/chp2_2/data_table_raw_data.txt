Analyzing a Distribution with Raw Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Earlier, we used Excel to calculate binomial probabilities and to find

data from the Helper/Hinderer example could be entered into JMP as
follows:

To get the test statistic and p-value in JMP, select **Analyze >
Distribution**. Enter the following:
