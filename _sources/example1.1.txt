Example 1.1: Alleged Hearing Loss
---------------------------------

Consider once again the example presented in an article by
Pankratz, Fausti, and Peed titled “A Forced-Choice Technique to
Evaluate Deafness in the Hysterical or Malingering Patient.”

Recall that the subject was correct on 36 out of 100 trials when he
was asked to identify whether the tone played with either the red or
the blue lightbulb.

Identify the following in the context of this example:

*  Population of interest:
*  Sample:
*  Variable of interest:
*  Data type:

Recall that we carried out a simulation study to determine whether this
patient who was suspected of malingering had obtained too few correct
answers. The results of the simulation study indicate what outcomes we
expect from a guessing subject:

+------------+
| |image1|   |
+------------+

.. admonition:: *Questions*

    Based on the results of this simulation study, do you
    believe the patient’s outcome of 36 correct out of 100 was consistent
    with guessing, or do these results indicate that he may have been
    answering incorrectly on purpose in order to mislead the researchers
    into believing he was hearing impaired?
