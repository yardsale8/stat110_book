Checking the Normality Assumption:
----------------------------------

For the t-test to be valid, at least one of the following conditions
must be met:

-  Either the sample size is sufficiently large (greater than 30 or so),
   or

-  The distribution of the observed data is approximately normal (which
   would indicate that the population is normally distributed so that
   the Central Limit Theorem would apply even with a small sample size)

Once again, since the sample size is fairly small, we must check to see
if the data are approximately normal:
