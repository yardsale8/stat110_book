NONPARAMETRIC TESTS: THE WILCOXON SIGNED RANK TEST
--------------------------------------------------

When problems with normality in the data are present, there exists an
alternative to the standard t-test: the *Wilcoxon Signed Rank* test.
This procedure does not require that the data be normally distributed;
however, THE DATA SHOULD BE SYMMETRIC IN ORDER FOR THIS PROCEDURE TO BE
APPROPRIATE.

Technically, this tests whether the *median* differs from some
hypothesized value. To carry out this nonparametric test in JMP,
choose this option when you select **Test Mean**:
