Nonparametric Tests
-------------------

These tests are an alternative to the two-sample t-test for comparing the
“average” value of two populations where the samples from each population are
taken independently. This test is appropriate when the assumption of normality
is violated (as it may have been in the previous example). To obtain the output
for these tests, simply select **Nonparametric >** from the drop-down menu in
the upper left-hand corner of the boxplots.

JMP returns the following output when the Wilcoxon Test is selected:

The decision based on Wilcoxon’s test is the same decision that we arrived at
using the standard two-sample t-test above. Often, these procedures will agree
each other because the above t-test is robust to (i.e. not greatly affected by)
departures from normality.
