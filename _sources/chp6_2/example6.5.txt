Example 6.5: Smoking and Birth Weight 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A study was conducted in which the relationship between smoking and birth
weights of babies was considered. The data can be found in the file
**LowBirth.JMP**, a portion of which is shown below.

.. note::

    The first observation for a nonsmoker is in NO WAY related to the first
    observation for a smoker. Therefore, these groups are *independent*.

Next, let’s examine birth weight across the two groups: smokers and
nonsmokers.

In JMP, we can compare the distributions by selecting **Analyze > Fit Y
by X.** Place the categorical variable (**Smoke**) in the **X, Factor**
box, and place the numerical variable of interest (**Actual\_Weight**)
in the **Y, Response** box. Select the “Display Options” menu from the
red drop-down arrow to display the boxplots and mean diamonds.

.. admonition:: Questions:

    1. Identify the following sample statistics from the JMP output:

    |image6123|

    2. We are interested in the true difference between these two population
       means. Based on the data, what is your best guess for this
       difference, and what does it indicate about birth weights for smokers
       compared to nonsmokers?

    3. If you were to take another sample, is your “best guess” from the
       previous question likely to change? Explain.


Since the difference will change from sample to sample, in order to make valid
inferences about the true population difference, we must first understand *how*
the difference in sample means is expected to change from sample to sample.  We
start by looking at the bootstrap distribution of the difference in means.

    .. mchoice:: unpaired_6_5_bootstrap_CI
        :answer_a: The birth weights were lower, on average, when the mother smoked.
        :answer_b: The birth weights were lower, on average, when the mother did not smoke.
        :answer_c: We cannot confidently conclude that the average birth weight was different, when comparing whether or not the mother smoked.
        :correct: a
        :feedback_a: Lower average weights when the mother smoked would result in No - Yes to be positive (i.e. Large - Small).
        :feedback_b: Lower average weights when the mother did not smoke would result in No - Yes to be negative (i.e. Small - Large).
        :feedback_c: We CAN make a confident conclusion as the interval is all positive.
         
        Note that the difference was computed using No - Yes.  Based on the bootstrap interval shown above, what conclusion should be drawn?

    .. mchoice:: unpaired_6_5_bootstrap_CI_interp
        :answer_a: We are 95% confident that, on average, the babies were between 80.9g and 487.8g heavier for the mothers that smoked.
        :answer_b: We are 95% confident that, on average, the babies were between 80.9g and 487.8g lighter for the mothers that smoked.
        :answer_c: We cannot confidently conclude that the average birth weight was different, let alone the size of the difference.
        :correct: b
        :feedback_a: Remember that positive number, when using No - Yes, indicates a lower average weights when the mother smoked.
        :feedback_b: Remember that positive number, when using No - Yes, indicates a lower average weights when the mother smoked.
        :feedback_c: We CAN make a confident conclusion as the interval is all positive.
         
        On average, how different were the weights between the two groups?


Testing a Hypothesis and the Null Distribution
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If we want to run a formal hypothesis test, we must determine what differences
in means are likely to happen by chance when taking random samples from
**populations with the same mean.** The following illustration in Tinkerplots gives
us some insight into this.

This should look familiar and remind you of the bootstrap. There is an important
difference, in that we need the null distribution to be centered at 0.  In the
next section, we will look at altering the boostrap distribution to make this
the case.
