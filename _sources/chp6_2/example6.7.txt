**Example 6.7: Tree Canopy Area** 

Consider the data found in the file **NYC\_Trees.JMP**.
Suppose you want to compare the canopy area of the two types of trees.
Is the average canopy area of a Honey Locust different from the average
canopy area of a Norway Maple? The data are summarized as follows:

It is clear that the SAMPLE of Norway Maple trees has a higher mean
canopy area than the SAMPLE of Honey Locust trees. However, to determine
whether the POPULATION mean canopy areas differ between the two groups,
we will carry out a hypothesis test.


**Step 0:** Check the assumptions behind the test to be sure that the test is valid.

            1. Are the two groups independent?

            2. Are both sample sizes sufficiently large? If not, is it reasonable to assume that both populations are normally distributed?

**Step 1:** Convert the research question into H\ :sub:`0` and H\ :sub:`a`

            H\ :sub:`0`:

            H\ :sub:`a`:

**Step 2:** Calculate a *test statistic* from your data.

**Step 3:** Determine the *p-value*.

            p-value =

**Step 4:** Write a conclusion in terms of the original research question.


Finally, we can construct a confidence interval for the difference in
means:

Lower Endpoint =

Upper Endpoint =

This confidence interval can also be written as:

Interpret the meaning of this 95% confidence interval:
