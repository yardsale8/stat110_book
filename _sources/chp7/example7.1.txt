Example 7.1: Lions’ Age and Proportion of Nose Blackness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It has been suggested that the amount of black pigmentation on the nose of male
lions increases with age. `Whitman et al.  (2004)
<http://www.savannasforever.org/docs/naturetrophy.pdf>`__ measured the
proportion of black on the noses of lions of known ages in Tanzania, East
Africa. These proportions were obtained from photos and digitally analyzed, and
a subset of the original data is given in the file **Lions.JMP**.

    Close-up colour photographs were taken of known-aged lions from the
    Serengeti and Ngotongoro Crater, Tanzania between 1999 and 2002. Each
    photograph was first digitized at high resolution into a .tif file, and the
    fleshy part of the nose (‘nose tip’) from each image was excised using Adobe
    Photoshop 4.01 LE. Then, the Spatial Analyst extension of ESRI Arcview 3.2
    was used to rasterize each cut-out nose tip and assign each newly created
    ‘grid’ a range of colour values. By limiting the colour values to either
    ‘black’ or ‘not black’, the nasal pigmentation pattern was ‘mapped’ and
    quantified for the percentage of readable pixels that contained ‘black’.
