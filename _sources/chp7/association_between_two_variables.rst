In this chapter we will be looking to identify any *association* between two
quantitative variables.  Consequently, we will be analyzing *bivariate data*.

.. glossary::

    Association between two variables
       We say that there is an **association between two variables** when we can
       use the value of one variable to improve out prediction of a second
       variable.
    Bivariate data
       **Biavariate data** consists of data that include two measurements on
       each individual.  Note that *bivariate* literally means "two variables."

Scatterplots and Displaying an Association
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Creating a scatterplot is always the first step in determining if two variables
are associated.  A scatterplot is a constructed by plotting a point at each of
the :math:`(x,y)` pairs, where :math:`x` and :math:`y` are the values of the x
and y variables for each individual, respectively.  Here is the scatterplot for
the data from example 7.1, which was created in JMP.

Please answer the following questions while considering this scatterplot.

.. admonition:: Question

   1. Could you use the graph to predict the proportion of nose blackness for a
      lion that was, say, 7 years old?  
   2. How close do you think you could get for a randomly selected 7-year-old
      lion? 
   3. Would the quality of your prediction benefit from knowing the lion's age?
      In what way?


In this case a standard interpretation of this scatterplot would make note of the following.

- We see that there is a *positive association*, as the proportion of nose
  blackness tends to increase as age increases.  

- The basic shape of the cloud of points is *linear*, or described fairly well
  with a line.  

- Finally, we see that most of the points would be fairly close to a line drawn
  through the middle of the points, which indicates that this association is
  fairly strong.  

.. admonition:: Creating a Scatterplot in JMP

    To create a scatterplot in JMP, you need to

    1. Enter the data in a new data table (**File > New > New Data Table**),
       being careful to keep the :math:`(x,y)` pairs on the same row.

    2. Go to **Analyze > Fit Y by X** and drag-and-drop the x and y variables in
       the correct box.

    3. Click **OK** and the scatterplot will be displayed.

In the next section, we will discuss the three components of our standard
interpretation of a scatterplot, the *direction*, *strength*, and *form* of the
association.

Describing an Association Between Variables
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As always, interpretions in statistics are just as important as calculations or
the construction of graphical displays of data.  When describing a possible
association between two variables, we will focus on the *direction*, *strength*,
and *form* of the association.

.. admonition:: Describing an association between variables

    When describing an association between two variables, we will focus on the
    following attributes of association.

    .. glossary::

         Direction of association
             The **direction** of an association is either *positive* or
             *negative*.

             - A **positive direction** is indicated by a positive or direct
               relationship between the x and y variables, i.e. y increases as x
               increases.
             - A **negative direction** is indicated by a negative or inverse
               relationship between the x and y variables, i.e. y decreases as x
               increases.

         Strength of association
             A **strength of association** is a measure of our ability to predict
             the variable y using the value of the variable x.  

             - A **strong association** is an indication that we can make exact
               guesses at the value of y using the value of x.  

             - A **weak association** is an indication that knowing the value of
               the x variable does not improve our ability to guess the value of
               the y variable.

         Form of the association
             The **form of the association** is a mathematical description of
             the basic shape suggested by the cloud of points.  Examples of
             possible forms might be *linear*, *quadratic*, or *sinusoidal*.  For
             the purposes of this course, we will describe the form in one of two
             ways.

             - A **linear** form is typified by a cloud of points that is fairly
               straight and described well by a line.
             
             - A **non-linear** form consists of a cloud of points that has a
               curved shape.

.. note::

    When describing a scatterplot, we need to be careful to examine the shape of
    the whole cloud of points, as opposed to looking too closely at any of the
    points in isolation or local clusters.  I like to think of this process as
    the **fat marker method** of describing the plot:  If I were to cover the
    cloud of points by drawing a line or curve with a fat marker, what shape
    would I use?  Did I need a curve to cover the points or was a straight line
    sufficient?

I find that the strength of the association is the most difficult trait to
describe, especially to someone that is new to statistics.  In the next section,
we will introduce a summary method that will help us determine the strength of a
linear association.
