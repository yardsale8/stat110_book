Example 1.4: Font Preferences
-----------------------------

Researchers carried out a marketing field study in order to study
preferences of potential consumers in the U.S. They used silver
cardboard boxes to contain chocolate truffles in a forced choice task.
All of the box tops were decorated in the same way, and a white label
was attached to each bearing the name “\ *Indulgence*\ ” in either
Signet font or Salem font. The text on each label was approximately
equal-sized. For each of the 40 subjects in the study, one box labeled
with the Signet font and another box labeled with the Salem font were
placed on a tray, and the subject was simply asked to choose a truffle
from one of the two boxes that were on the tray in front of them.

The researchers aren’t sure which font is more appropriate for the
label and simply want to know whether the majority of all consumers
will choose the truffles with one font more than the other. In the
sample of 40 subjects, 30 chose to take a truffle from the box that
had Signet font.

.. admonition:: Research Question 
    Do the majority of consumers have a preference for one font over the other?

.. admonition:: *Questions*

    1. Identify the following in the context of this example:

       -  Population of interest:

       -  Sample:

       -  Variable of interest:

       -  Data type:

    2. If there was no preference in the population, how many of the 40
       consumers do you *expect* to choose Signet font? Explain.

To gain an understanding of what outcomes we expect to see if there is
no real preference in the population of all consumers, we will
*simulate* this experiment under the condition that there is no
preference for one font over the other. 

.. admonition:: Simulation

    Carry out the Tinkerplots
    simulation. Note that you should consider the following questions when
    designing your simulation study:

    -  What are the two possible outcomes on each of the trials? Change the
       values on your spinner accordingly.

    -  What is the probability that each outcome occurs under the assumption
       that there is no preference in the population? Change your spinner
       accordingly.

    -  Be sure to change the **Draw** value to 1.

    -  How many subjects were there in this study? Keep this value in mind
       when setting the **Repeat** value.

    Carry out the simulation study 1000 times overall, keeping track of the
    number that choose Signet on each of the simulated experiments.

    3. What does each dot on this plot represent?

    4. **In the actual study, 30 of the 40 selected the Signet font. Does**
       this outcome convince you that there is a preference for one font
       over the other? Why or why not?
