Simulating the Guessing Distribution
------------------------------------

In each of the examples in this chapter, we will be using TinkerPlots to
simulate a distribution that is in contrast to our research hypothesis.  In the
case of evaluating the truthfullness of the claimant in the hearing loss
example, our hypothesis is that the claimant was being purposefully mistruthful
when answering the questions.  To test this claim, we will simulate the opposite
distribution, that is the distribution of someone that cannot hear and is simply
guessing which color is associated with the sound.  We are looking for evidence
that the claimant missed an unusual number of questions, compared to the number
of correct answers of someone that was just guessing. 

.. note:: 

    Recall that we use a p-value to determing if a specified value is unusual.
    You might wish to review the section on p-values!

In the following video, we will illustrate simulating the guessing distribution
and calculating a p-value using TinkerPlots.
