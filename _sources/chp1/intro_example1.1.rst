Consider the following case study centered on potential insurance fraud
regarding deafness. This case study was presented in an article by
Pankratz, Fausti, and Peed titled “A Forced-Choice Technique to Evaluate
Deafness in the Hysterical or Malingering Patient.” *Source: Journal of
Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 1975, Vol. 43, pg. 421-422.* The
following is an excerpt from the article:

    The patient was a 27-year-old male with a history of multiple
    hospitalizations for idiopathic convulsive disorder, functional
    disabilities, accidents, and personality problems. His hospital
    records indicated that he was manipulative, exaggerated his symptoms
    to his advantage, and that he was a generally disruptive patient. He
    made repeated attempts to obtain compensation for his disabilities.
    During his present hospitalization he complained of bilateral
    hearing loss, left-sided weakness, left-sided numbness, intermittent
    speech difficulty, and memory deficit. There were few consistent or
    objective findings for these complaints. All of his symptoms
    disappeared quickly with the exception of the alleged hearing loss.

| To assess his alleged hearing loss, testing was conducted       | |image113| |
| through earphones with the subject seated in a sound-treated    |            | 
| audiology testing chamber. Visual stimuli utilized during the   |            | 
| investigation were produced by a red and a blue light bulb,     |            | 
| which were mounted behind a one-way mirror so that the subject  |            | 
| could see the bulbs only when they were illuminated by the      |            | 
| examiner. The subject was presented several trials on each of   |            | 
| which the red and then the blue light was turned on            |            | 
| consecutively for 2 seconds each. On each trial, a 1,000-Hz     |            |  
| tone was randomly paired with the illumination of either the    |            | 
| blue or red light bulb, and the subject was instructed to       |            | 
| indicate with which light bulb the tone was paired. Because     |            | 
| the researchers were implementing a “forced-choice” technique,  |            | 
| the subject was forced to answer each time with either “red”    |            | 
| or “blue.”                                                      |            |
