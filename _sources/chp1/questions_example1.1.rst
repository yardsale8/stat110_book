Questions about Example 1.1
---------------------------

Recall that the subject was correct on 36 out of 100 trials when he
was asked to identify whether the tone played with either the red or
the blue light bulb.

.. admonition:: Check your understanding

    .. mchoice:: mc_example11_population
        :answer_a: All trials of the experiment for a hearing impaired individual.
        :answer_b: The 100 answer of a hearing impaired person that were observed.
        :answer_c: Whether or not the hearing impaired person answered correctly.
        :correct: a
        :feedback_a: Here we are imagining giving the survey to a claimant many, many times.  This allows us to imagine what the number of correct answers should be if a person was truly guessing.

         What is the population of interest?

    .. mchoice:: mc_example11_sample
        :answer_a: All trials of the experiment for a hearing impaired individual.
        :answer_b: The 100 answer of a hearing impaired person that were observed.
        :answer_c: Whether or not the hearing impaired person answered correctly.
        :correct: b
        :feedback_b: We are thinking of the 100 answers are the sample for this experiement. In particular, we would note whether or not each questions was answered correctly.a

         Which of the following best describes the sample?

    .. mchoice:: mc_example11_variable
        :answer_a: All trials of the experiment for a hearing impaired individual.
        :answer_b: The 100 answer of a hearing impaired person that were observed.
        :answer_c: Whether or not the hearing impaired person answered correctly.
        :correct: c
        :feedback_c: We are thinking of the 100 answers are the sample for this experiement. In particular, we would note whether or not each questions was answered correctly.a

         Which of the following best describes the variable?

Recall that we carried out a simulation study to determine whether this
patient who was suspected of malingering had obtained too few correct
answers. The results of the simulation study indicate what outcomes we
expect from a guessing subject:

.. mchoice:: mc1.1_1
    :answer_a: One set of 100 trials
    :answer_b: One correct guess
    :answer_c: One trial
    :answer_d: The number of correct guesses in 100 trials
    :correct: d
    :feedback_a: HINT: Last class we recorded the number of correct guesses in 12 trials, but now we are doing 100 trials.  What should we record?
    :feedback_b: HINT: Last class we recorded the number of correct guesses in 12 trials, but now we are doing 100 trials.  What should we record?
    :feedback_c: HINT: Last class we recorded the number of correct guesses in 12 trials, but now we are doing 100 trials.  What should we record?
    :feedback_d: Each dot represents to the number of correct guesses in 100 trials

    What does each dot/star represent?

.. mchoice:: mc1.1_2
    :answer_a: Answering incorrectly on purpose
    :answer_b: Consistent with guessing
    :correct: a
    :feedback_a: This answer would not be consistent with guessing, as the number of times that a hearing impaired person would guess 36 or fewer correct is very low.
    :feedback_b: Guessing 36 correct is not a typical result.  Notice that it is very rare to guess 36 or fewer correct. If someone is guessing, it would be much more likely to between 40 and 60 answers correct.

    Based on the results of this simulation study, do you
    believe the patient’s outcome of 36 correct out of 100 was consistent
    with guessing, or do these results indicate that he may have been
    answering incorrectly on purpose in order to mislead the researchers
    into believing he was hearing impaired?

.. mchoice:: mc1.1_3
    :answer_a: Yes
    :answer_b: No
    :correct: b
    :feedback_a: To <i>confidently</i> establish that the person was answering incorrectly on purpose, we would need the person to get an <i>unusually</i> small number of correct answers.  In this case, 48 correct would **not** be unusual as it happened fairly frequently in the simultion.
    :feedback_b: While the person may have been answering incorrectly on purpose, their results were not unusual when compaired to someone that was guessing.  Therefore we cannot <i>confidently</i> conclude that this person was making mistakes on purpose.

    Now suppose that another person was tested in the same way, and this person
    answered 48 out of the 100 trials correctly.  Can we **confidently** conclude
    that this person was purposefully answering the questions
    incorrectly?
