Example 1.3: Are Women Passed Over for Managerial Training?
-----------------------------------------------------------

This example involves possible discrimination against female
employees. Suppose a large supermarket chain occasionally selects
employees to receive management training. A group of female employees
has claimed that they are less likely than male employees of similar
qualifications to be chosen for this training.
The large employee pool that can be tapped for management training is
60% female and 40% male; however, since the management program began,
9 of the 20 employees chosen for management training were female (only
45%). Do the female employees have a valid statistical argument that
they are being discriminated against?

    Is there statistical evidence for gender discrimination against females?

.. admonition:: *Questions*

    1. Identify the following in the context of this example:

       -  Population of interest:

       -  Sample:

       -  Variable of interest:

       -  Data type:

    2. If the selection process was unbiased, how many of the 20 employees
       selected for management do you *expect* to be women? Explain.

Once again, the key question is how to determine whether the result is
surprising under the assumption that the selection process is unbiased.
To answer this, we will *simulate* the process of an unbiased selection
process, over and over again. Each time we simulate the process, we’ll
keep track of how many of the 20 employees selected for management were
female. Once we’ve repeated this process a large number of times, we’ll
have a pretty good sense for what outcomes would be very surprising,
somewhat surprising, or not so surprising if there was no discrimination
in the selection process.

.. admonition:: Simulation

    Carry out the Tinkerplots simulation. Note that you should consider the
    following questions when designing your simulation study:

    -  What are the two possible outcomes on each of the trials? Change the
       values on your spinner accordingly.

    -  What is the probability that each outcome occurs under the assumption
       that there is no gender discrimination in the selection process?
       Change your spinner accordingly.

    -  Be sure to change the **Draw** value to 1 since only one employee was
       chosen at a time.

    -  How many subjects were there in this study? Keep this value in mind
       when setting the **Repeat** value.

    Carry out the simulation study 1000 times overall, keeping track of the
    number of the employees chosen for management that were female on each
    of the simulated experiments.

.. admonition:: *Questions*

    3. What does each dot on this plot represent?

    4. Recall that since the management program began, only 9 of the 20
       employees chosen for management training were female. Does this
       outcome convince you that the selection process is biased against
       women? Why or why not?
