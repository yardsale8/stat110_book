We can carry out the hypothesis test as follows to determine whether
body weights of college students tend to increase over Thanksgiving
break.

Checking the Normality Assumption:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Recall that for the t-test to be valid, at least one of the following
conditions must be met:

-  Either the sample size is sufficiently large (greater than 30 or so),
   or

-  The distribution of the observed data is approximately normal (which
   would indicate that the population is normally distributed so that
   the Central Limit Theorem would apply even with a small sample size)

    Does the t-test appear to be a valid approach for testing this research
    question? Justify your reasoning.

**Step 1: Set up the null and alternative hypotheses**

H\ :sub:`o`:

H\ :sub:`a`:

**Step 2: Find the t-statistic and the p-value**

.. math::

    SE_{difference} = \frac{s_{difference}}{\sqrt{n}}\\
    t = \frac{\bar{x}_{difference} - \mu_{difference}}{SE_{difference}}

To calculate this test statistic and its associated p-value in JMP,
use the methods discussed in Chapter 5:

p-value =

**Step 3: Write a conclusion in the context of the problem**

Interpreting the 95% confidence interval for the mean difference**

    When calculating the difference, you switched the order of the categories:
