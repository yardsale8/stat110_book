What is data?  To answer this question, we will first focus on an individual
piece of data and then think about a collection of data.  Please watch the video

Understanding Data Individually
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Data consists of a **measurement** taken on a **person or thing**.  In statistics, we
call the measurement a *variable* and the item being measured an *individual* or
*unit*.

.. glossary::
    Individual or Unit
        The object or person being measured.  
    Variable
        The specific measurement that is being taken on an individual.

.. note::

    When identifing the **variable(s)** related to a study, it is helpful to
    think of the question(s) that we would ask about the individual.

Here are some examples of data from my own life

    * I rated the last movie I streamed online as 3 stars (out of 5 stars).
    * My current phone has 64 GB of flash memory.
    * This morning I consumed two 20 oz glasses of iced tea.

In each case, we can think of the description as a measurement on some
individual unit.


.. TODO: Add an example with a poor variable description like "shoes" instead of
..       "whether or not ..."

.. admonition:: Check your understanding - Individuals

    **Identify the individuals (What is the unit being measured?)**

        While it might be possible to think of the individual here as *me* and not
        *my phone*, there could be problems with this designation.  For example,
        what if I own two phones?  We need to be very careful and specific when
        defining an individual.

        Identify the variable.


Understanding Data Collectively
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Rarely do we analyze one piece of data, instead we use a collection of data to
make our conclusions.  In particular, we identify two important collections of
individuals.

.. glossary:: 

    Population
        All of the individuals of interest.  This is the group that we would
        collect data on if time/money were no concern.  Typically, it is
        impossible to collect data on the entire population.

    Sample
        A sample is a subset of a population and is much more manageable to
        obtain.  In statistics we use samples to make guesses about populations.

A well-designed study will have a clearly defined population and collect a
sample that is representative of this population.

.. admonition:: Important Point

    The type of conclusions that we can draw depend on 
    
    1. The type of collection we have
    2. The manner in which the collection was calculated.

When designing a sampling scheme, **bias** is our primary concern and **the only
way to ensure unbiased results is to use random sampling.** If, on the other
hand,  we have the entire population, then we don't need to worry about sampling
bias, but we still need to worry about other forms of bias. In particular, when
collecting a survey we will be concerned about whether the responses match the
individuals true opinion or whether we have asked leading questions (more on
this later).

Summarizing Data Numerically
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Once we have acquired data, we typically summarize the data in two ways.

1. Create graphs
2. Compute numerical summaries

When we talk about numerical summaries of data, like the average or median
value, we make a distinction between summaries that come from a sample (thought
of as a guess) and numerical summaries that come from a population (thought of
as the exact value).

.. glossary::

    Parameter
        A number that summarizes a **population**.
    Statistic
        A number that summarizes a **sample**.

One of our first tasks will be to read a summary about a study involving data
and identify each of the important components.  These include

1. The individuals/units
2. The variable(s)
3. The type of collection
4. The summary method(s)

.. caution::

    Be careful about confusing the summary method with the variable.  The
    variable describes what we collect **for each individual** and the summary
    method is how we **combine the data** into one number.


.. admonition:: Determine if the given summary method is a *parameter* or *statistic*.

   .. mchoice:: mc_parastat_1
        :answer_a: Parameter
        :answer_b: Statistic
        :correct: b
        :feedback_a: This study only included 318 students, now the entire student body.
        :feedback_b: A population would have included the whole student body, not just 318 students.

        In a survey of 318 Winona State students, it was found that 53.8% of the
        students selected a PC for their laptop.

        :feedback_b: A sample would have included a sample of some of the 50 states, not information about all 50 states.:w

        The average salary of all 50 United States governors in 2015 was
        $135,000.

Types of Variables
++++++++++++++++++

There are two main types of data and this data type will determine the
appropriate statistical procedures.  First, we have *quantitative* data.  The
root of quantitative is quantity, so you might not be surprised that
quantitative data represents a *quantity*.

.. glossary::
    Quantitative Data
        Data that is

        1. numerical
        2. Represents a quantity of something

        In particular, we need a quantity measured in some form of standard unit, 
        like inches or kilograms.

By its nature, most arithmetic on quantitative data results in a meaningful
value.

.. admonition:: Example 1 - Height

    The height of a person is *quantitative* because, 1) it is numerical and 2)
    it represents a quantity (say in inches).  The difference between my height
    and the height of my wife is 9 inches and we see that subtracting these two
    values gave you some meaningful information.

On the other hand, there is some data that is numerical but not quantitative.
In this case, subtracting two values does not give meaningful information.

.. admonition:: Example 2 - Jersey number

    An example of data that is numerical, but not quantitative is the number on
    a football player's jersey.  Clay Matthews and Aaron Rodgers are wear
    numbers 52 and 12, respectively.  The fact that the difference between their
    numbers is 40 isn't very meaningful.  meaningful

All data that is not quantitative is called either *categorical* or
*qualitative*.

.. glossary::
    Categorical Data
       Data that is not quantitative.  This type of data can be broken into a
       number of categories or labeled groups.

.. admonition:: Determine if each variable is *quantitative* or *categorical*.

    .. mchoice:: mc_type_1
        :answer_a: Quantitative
        :answer_b: Categorical
        :correct: a
        :feedback_a: This variable is bother numerical and represents a quantity in GB
        :feedback_b: Think of an example value.  Ask yourself (1) is it numerical and (2) does it represent a quantity.

         The amount of flash memory in a smartphone.


    .. mchoice:: mc_type_2
        :answer_a: Quantitative
        :answer_b: Categorical
        :correct: b
        :feedback_a: Think of an example value.  Ask yourself (1) is it numerical and (2) does it represent a quantity.
        :feedback_b: This variable is not numeric 

         The color of a smart phone.

In the first activity, we observed that hand selecting our samples lead to
*bias*, which is defined as follows.

.. glossary::
    Bias
        The tendency to over- or under-estimate the value of a parameter over
        many sample estimates.

There are three main sources of bias in discussed below.

.. glossary::
    Sample Bias
        The tendency to select some values more than others.  The best (only) method of
        combating this form of bias is *using random sampling*.
    Nonresponse Bias
        When performing a survey of people, we typically get a very small
        percent of people responding.  Furthermore, people with strong opinions
        or interest in the topic are more likely to respond, which can lead to
        biased estimates.
    Response Bias
       This form of bias occurs when the participant's answers do not match the
       true feelings of the participants.  This can happen when, for example, a
       survey consists of *leading questions*.

.. note::
    The most important point here is that we prefer random samples, as they
    guarantee unbiased samples (in terms of sampling bias).

.. mchoice:: mc_bias_1
    :answer_a: Sampling Bias
    :answer_b: Non-response Bias
    :answer_c: Response Bias
    :correct: a
    :feedback_a: The survey only collected data on readers of *Literary Digest*, leading to other segments of the population being under-represented.
    :feedback_b: With more than 2.4 million people responding, non-response wouldn't be an issue.
    :feedback_c: There is nothing in the problem to suggest a problem with response bias (such as leading questions etc.)

    In 1936, *Literary Digest* magazine conducted a survey of their readers, 
    asking their readers if they would vote for Roosevelt or Landon.  More than
    2.4 million people responded, and more than 57% responded that they would
    vote for Landon.  In the actual election, Roosevelt won by a landslide,
    earning more than 63% of the popular vote.  Determine the source of bias in
    this sampling procedure.

There are two main types of studies that we will be considering this semester,
*observational studies* and *experiments*.

.. glossary::
    Observational Study
       A study in which no variable is manipulated or affected by the researcher
       and instead the variables are observed in their natural state.
    Experiment
        A study where some of the variables (called explanatory variables) are
        controlled and manipulated by the researcher and the effect of these
        changes is measured on another variable (called the response variable).
    Explanatory Variable
        A variable that we think might explain the changes in another variable
        (called the *response variable*).  In an experiment, the research will
        control and manipulate the response variable.
    Response Variable
        A variable that is not manipulated in any way.  We are looking for an
        effect that the explanatory variable might have on the response

In class, we conducted some simulations to identity the effect on two forms of
randomization, *randomized selection of individual units* and *random assignment
of treatments* in an experiment.  Based on these activities, we identified two
main effects of randomization.

.. admonition:: The effect of random selection of individuals in sampling

    Using a random sampling technique to select individuals resulted in
    **unbiased estimates** of parameters.  In other words, our statistics did not
    tend to over- or under-estimate the parameter, but balanced these errors
    instead.  (This assumes no other source of bias.)

.. admonition:: The effect of using random assignment of treatments in an experiment.

    Using random assignment of treatments tended to balance out other factors
    between the groups.  Therefore, other factors are not a likely cause of the
    differences between the groups and the most likely cause of any difference
    in the groups is the differences in treatments.
    
When evaluating a statistical study, the first thing that should be considered
is the *appropriate scope of the conclusions*, that is to say the types of
conclusions that are justified for this type of study.  The following table
gives some advice on what conclusions can be drawn based on

    1. Whether or not there was random sampling.
    2. Whether or not it was an experiment with random assignment of treatments.

.. admonition:: A study on flossing and gum disease (experiment)

    A recent study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of flossing on
    gum disease.  A group of 500 volunteers were randomly split into two groups.
    The first group was asked to floss once a day and the second group was asked
    to floss after each meal.  Suppose that the group that flossed after every
    meal was much less likely to have gum disease as the group that flossed
    once per day.

    .. mchoice:: mc_evaluate_1
        :answer_a: Yes
        :answer_b: No
        :correct: b
        :feedback_a: Note that the description mentioned that the participants were volunteers.
        :feedback_b: The participants volunteered and were not randomly selected.

        Did this study use random sampling?

    .. mchoice:: mc_evaluate_2
        :answer_a: Yes, the effects the flossing treatments would be the same for the general population.
        :answer_b: No, there is a danger that our estimates of the effects of flossing on gum disease is likely biased.
        :correct: b
        :feedback_a: The participants in the study were volunteers and not a randomly selected sample.
        :feedback_b: The lack of a randomly selected sample means that we are in danger of biased estimates.

        Is it safe to generalize the results of this study?

        :answer_a: Yes
        :answer_b: No
        :correct: a
        :feedback_b: Note that the text mentions that the participants were randomly split into groups.

        Did this study use random assignment of treatments?

    .. mchoice:: mc_evaluate_4
        :answer_a: Yes, the treatments are the only *likely* explanation for the differences.
        :answer_b: No, other factors are likely to have contributed to the difference.
        :correct: a
        :feedback_a: Random assignment of the treatments will likely balance all other factors leading to gum disease.
        :feedback_b: Consider the effect of randomly assigning the flossing treatments on the other likely factors.

        Based on the fact that there was a large difference between the groups, is 
        it safe to say that the difference in flossing frequency was the most likely 
        cause of these differences?

.. admonition:: Another study on flossing and gum disease (observational study)

    In another study on flossing and gum disease, a random sample of 500 people
    were surveyed on their flossing habits and whether or not they suffered from
    gum disease.  Suppose that it was estimated that the people that flossed 
    after every meal was much less likely to have gum disease as the group 
    that flossed once per day.

    .. mchoice:: mc_evaluate_5
        :answer_a: Yes
        :answer_b: No
        :correct: a
        :feedback_b: The text explicitly mentioned a random sample.

        Did this study use random sampling?

    .. mchoice:: mc_evaluate_6
        :answer_a: Yes, the effects the flossing treatments will be the same for the general population.
        :answer_b: No, there is a danger that our estimates of the effects of flossing on gum disease is likely biased.
        :correct: a
        :feedback_a: Because we are taking a random sample, our statistics should be unbiased and not over- or under-estimate the rates of gum disease in each group.

        cause of these differences?

Summarizing Data
----------------

Next, we will present some basic methods for summarizing data both numerically
and graphically.

In particular, we will be looking to describe the **distribution** of the data,
which which consists of a list of feasible values for the data along with how
often these values tend to occur.  When describing a distribution, we will focus
on answer four questions.

1. What is the shape of the distribution?
2. What is a typical value?  (or equivalently) Where is the center of the distribution?
3. How are the values spread out?
4. Are there any outliers?

In the next few sections, we will cover graphical and numerical methods for
answer these questions.

Shapes of a Distribution
++++++++++++++++++++++++

One of the important features of a distribution is the shape of the
distribution.  In this class, we will describe the shape of the distribution in
words using terms like *symmetric*, *skewed left*, *skewed right*, and
*bimodal*.

.. glossary::
    Symmetric
        A distribution is described as *symmetric* if portion of the graph to
        the left of the mean/average is approximately a *mirror image* of the
        portion of the graph to the right side of the mean/average.

|image-sum0|

We will distinguish between symmetric graphs that are *bell-shaped* or *not
bell-shaped*.

On the other hand, when a distribution is **not** symmetric, we focus on the
*tails* of the distribution.

.. glossary::
    Skewed Left
        A distribution is *skewed left* when it has a long left tail, that is
        its left tail is much longer than its right tail.
    Skewed Right
        A distribution is *skewed right* when it has a long right tail, that is
        its right tail is much longer than its left tail.
|image-sum1|

Finally, it is possible that we might have a graph with two peaks.

.. glossary::
    Bimodal
        A distribution is *bimodal* if it has two distinct peaks.  (The term
        bimodal literally means *two modes*, where a mode is a peak.)

.. glossary::
    Mean or Average
        This is the (arithmetic) average of the data.  It is calculated by
        adding all the values of the variable and dividing by the number of
        individuals.
    Median
        A value that splits the data into groups that consist of approximately
        half of the data.  It is computed by (1) Putting the data in order and
        (2) Finding the middle value.  If the data set has an even number of
        values, the average of the middle two values is used for the median.

While being able to compute the value of a summary statistic is important, *it
is even more important to understand what each number tells us about the
distribution.  Here are the standard interpretations for these statistics.

.. admonition:: Standard Interpretation of the Mean

    The mean is the balance point or center of mass of the distribution, that
    is, it is the location at which the dot plot would balance on your finger.

.. admonition:: Standard Interpretation of the Median

    The median splits the data in half.  Approximately 50% of the data will be
    above and below the median. (The only situation where this is not exactly 50%
    is when there are multiple values stacked at the median.)

Measures of Spread - Finding the Amount of Concentration or Spread

In an earlier section, we took on the task of determining a "typical value".
The answer was to use a measurement in the center of the distribution of like
the mean and median.  Unfortunately, knowing the location of the center of the
distribution is not enough information.

|image-sum6|

For example, the two graphs shown above have centers that are very similar, but
one graph has data that is more concentrated than another.  This difference is
very important in many fields.  In manufacturing, creating products that are
very similar can reduce waste, and in statistics, having estimates that are
more concentrated, or less spread out, means that we are making better guesses.

The most basic measurement of spread is the *range* of the data.

.. glossary::
    Range
        The difference/distance between the largest and smallest value in the
        data set.

Unfortunately, the range is very susceptible to outliers, making it a poor
measure of spread.  We will instead use two other measures of spread, the
*interquartile range (IQR)* and the *standard deviation (from the mean)*.

.. mchoice::  q751
    :answer_a: The difference between the smallest and largest values in the data.
    :answer_b: The distance between a typical/average value and the mean.
    :answer_c: The the range of the middle 50% of the data.
    :correct: b
    :feedback_a: This is the range of the data.
    :feedback_c: This is the interquartile range.

    The standard deviation can be thought of as ...

.. glossary::
    Interquartile range (IQR)
        The range of the middle 50% of the data.  It is found by (a) finding the
        medians of the lower and upper halves of the data, called Q1 and Q3,
        respectively.  Then the :math:`IQR = Q3 - Q1`.
    Standard Deviation (SD)
        The standard deviation is computed using the formula given below.  It
        can be thought of as the distance of a typical/average value to the
        mean.

.. math::

    SD = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}

For both statistics, the value indicates how concentrated or spread out the
data is.

1. A larger value of the SD or IQR means that the data is more spread out.
2. A smaller value of the SD or IQR means that the data is more concentrated.

As mentioned earlier, understanding how to interpret the value of a statistic is
perhaps more important than being able to compute the value.  Here are the
standard interpretations of each of these statistics.

.. admonition:: Standard Interpretation of the Standard Deviation

    The standard deviation tells us how far a typical value is from the mean.

.. admonition:: Standard Interpretation of the Interquartile Range

    The interquartile range measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data.

.. admonition:: Resistance

    The IQR is more resistant to the effects of outliers than the standard
    deviation.

Unusual Values and the p-Value
-----------------------------

.. raw:: html

    <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 col-xs-12 text-center">
    <iframe id="kaltura_player" src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/812561/sp/81256100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/33140371/partner_id/812561?iframeembed=true&playerId=kaltura_player&entry_id=0_b91c7frv&flashvars[mediaProtocol]=rtmp&amp;flashvars[streamerType]=rtmp&amp;flashvars[streamerUrl]=rtmp://www.kaltura.com:1935&amp;flashvars[rtmpFlavors]=1&amp;flashvars[localizationCode]=en&amp;flashvars[leadWithHTML5]=true&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.position]=left&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.clickToClose]=true&amp;flashvars[chapters.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[chapters.layout]=vertical&amp;flashvars[chapters.thumbnailRotator]=false&amp;flashvars[streamSelector.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[EmbedPlayer.SpinnerTarget]=videoHolder&amp;flashvars[dualScreen.plugin]=true&amp;&wid=0_0ep0lw91" width="420" height="336" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozAllowFullScreen frameborder="0"></iframe>
    </div>

We will spend a considerable amount of time in this course trying to decide if a
value is unusually large or unusually small.  For example, if we were trying to determine if the
hiring practices in a school district are discriminatory, we will need to
determine if the school hires an unusually low number of African-American
teachers.

Before we can determine if a value is unusual, we need a good definition of what it
means to be unusually large or unusually small in a statistical sense.

.. glossary::

    Unusually large values
        A value is considered unusually large if it is in the largest 5% of the
        distribution.
    Unusually small values
        A value is considered unusually small if it is in the smallest 5% of the
        distribution.

.. note::

     There is nothing special about picking 5%, and in fact later in the course
     we will see that adjusting this value gives us some control over a certain
     type of error. For now, we will stick to 5% and call this **the 5% rule**.

|image-sum3|

Now that we know what it means to be unusually large or small, we
need a method of determining if a specific value of interest is unusually large.  
For example, I have a friend that is 78 inches tall (6' 6").  I know that he is
fairly tall, but is he unusually tall, in the statistical sense?

When answering this question intuitively, I believe that it is natural to
compare my friend to other tall people, asking *What
percentage of the time do I meet men that is 78 inches tall or taller*.  This
is the exact intuition that leads to our definition of an *upper p-value*.  

On the other hand, we might ask if someone that is 63.5 inches tall, like my
wife, is unusually short. Again in a statistical sense.  This time it is natural
to compare someone on the small side of the distribution with other small
values, leading to what I like to call a *lower p-value*.

.. glossary::
    Upper p-value
        The upper p-value of a given value :math:`x` is the proportion of the 
        distribution that is at or above the value.  This measurement is useful
        in determining if a value is unusually large.
    Lower p-value
        The lower p-value of a given value :math:`x` is the proportion of the 
        distribution that is at or below the value. This measurement is useful
        in determining if a value is unusually small.

Example: Using a lower p-value to determine if 4 is unusually small.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Consider the distribution shown below.  There are 117 dots on the graph, and we
want to answer the question *Is the value 4 unusually small*.  Because we are
focusing on small values, we will use a *lower p-value*, because it makes sense
to compare a potentially small value to other small values.  There are 7 dots
that are at or below 4, so the lower p-value of 4 rounds up to 0.06 or 6%. Since 
there is more than 5% of the distribution below 4, **4 is not in the smallest 5%
of the distribution** and therefore is not unusually small.

|image-sum4|

Thus, a value is only unusually small if its lower p-value is smaller than 5%
(when using the 5% rule).  The same is true for an upper p-value.  


Example: Using an upper p-value to determine if 12 is unusually large.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This time, consider the question *Is 12 unusually large?*  In this case the 
upper p-value is a little less than 1%.  Since less than 5% of the distribution 
is above 12, we see that

    1. 12 is in the largest 1%, and
    2. 12 is unusually large, according to the 5% rule.

    Suppose that a value has an upper p-value of 12.7%.  According to the 5% rule, is this value unusually large?

.. admonition:: General P-value Rule

    A value is unusually small when the lower p-value is less than 5% (when
    using the 5% rule). 

    A value is unusually large when the upper p-value is less than 5% (when
    using the 5% rule).

    **In both cases, small p-values mean unusual values**.
