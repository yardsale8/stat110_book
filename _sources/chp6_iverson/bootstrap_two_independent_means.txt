Researchers at Pennsylvania State University investigated whether
time perception, a simple indication of a person’s ability to
concentrate, is impaired during nicotine withdrawal. Twenty smokers
were randomly assigned to a 24-hour smoking abstinence and were
asked to estimate how much time had passed during a 45-second
period. Another 20 smokers were randomly assigned to a group which
was *not* forced to abstain from nicotine; they were also asked to
estimate how much time had passed during a 45-second period. Suppose
the resulting data on perceived elapsed time (in seconds) were
analyzed as shown below (these results are artificial but are
similar to the actual findings). The data can be found in the file
**Nicotine\_all.JMP**.

.. admonition:: Research Question: 

    Do those smokers suffering from nicotine withdrawal tend to believe that
    more time has elapsed than do those not suffering from nicotine withdrawal?

.. admonition:: Questions:

    .. mchoice:: chp7_unpaired_time_response
        :answer_a: The perceived elapsed time for each subject.
        :answer_b: Whether or not the person was suffering from withdrawal.
        :answer_c: The average perceived elapsed time for all subjects.
        :correct: a
        :feedback_a: The groups (withdrawal or not) are compared on perceived elapsed time, making it the response.
        :feedback_b: When comparing groups, the groups label is the explanatory variable.
        :feedback_c: This is a summary method, not a variable.

        What is the response variable in this study?

    .. mchoice:: chp7_unpaired_time_explanatory
        :answer_a: The perceived elapsed time for each subject.
        :answer_b: Whether or not the person was suffering from withdrawal.
        :answer_c: The average perceived elapsed time for all subjects.
        :correct: b
        :feedback_a: The groups (withdrawal or not) are compared on perceived elapsed time, making it the response.
        :feedback_b: When comparing groups, the groups label is the explanatory variable.
        :feedback_c: This is a summary method, not a variable.

        What is the explanatory variable in this study?

    .. mchoice:: chp7_unpaired_time_alternate
        :answer_a: µ_no - µ_with > 0
        :answer_b: µ_no - µ_with < 0
        :answer_c: µ_no - µ_with ≠ 0
        :correct: b
        :feedback_a: If withdrawal leads to a larger perceived time, then No - Yes would be negative (i.e. Small - Larger)
        :feedback_b: If withdrawal leads to a larger perceived time, then No - Yes would be negative (i.e. Small - Larger)
        :feedback_c: We use not-equal when looking for a difference, either way.

        Which of the following is the correct alternative hypothesis?


    .. mchoice:: chp7_unpaired_time_pvalue
        :answer_a: Lower/left-tail
        :answer_b: Upper/right-tail
        :answer_c: Two-tail
        :correct: a
        :feedback_a: If withdrawal leads to a larger perceived time, then No - Yes would be negative (i.e. Small - Larger), so we want to use a lower/left-tail p-value.
        :feedback_b: If withdrawal leads to a larger perceived time, then No - Yes would be negative (i.e. Small - Larger), so we want to use a lower/left-tail p-value.
        :feedback_c: Two-tail p-values are for questions that are looking for a difference, either way.
         
        What is the correct p-value for this question (when computing No - With)?


To use the bootstrap distribution to run a hypothesis test, we need to generate
the bootstrap distribution then move the distribution so that the mean is
centered at the hypothetical mean.  

In JMP, we can use the bootstrap to perform a test for the difference in means, by
following these steps.

.. admonition:: Bootstrap Test in JMP

    a. Save the data somewhere that is easy to access.

    b. Open the **Randomized Test** add-in, click **Use Other Data**, and
       open the **Nicotine\_all.jmp** data file.

       |image640| |image641|

    c. Highlight the Y and X variables.

       |image642|

    d. Generate the bootstrap distribution centered at 0. This is due to the
       fact that we are testing to see if there is a difference between the groups,
       and consequently the null hypothesis will represent "no difference."

       |image643|

    e. Note the direction of subtraction on the right hand side. We will
       need to make sure our alternate hypothesis’s direction matches this
       subtraction.

       |image644|

    f. At this point we can determine the null and alternative hypothesis,
       (including the correct order of subtraction.) We do this by considering the
       research hypothesis in light of the order of subtraction.  In this case, the
       research hypothesis has :math"`\mu_{with}` bigger than :math:`\mu_{no}`, so
       :math:`H_{a}:\mu_{\text{no}} - \mu_{\text{with}} < 0`.

    g. Pick and record the correct p-value for this test.

        |image645|

        p-value =

.. admonition:: Question:

    1. Based on this p-value, write the correct conclusion for this test.
