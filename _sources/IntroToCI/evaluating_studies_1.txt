In class, we conducted some simulations to identity the effect of the first of
two forms of randomization, *randomized selection of individual units*.  Based
on these activities, we identified two main effects of randomization.

.. admonition:: The effect of random selection of individuals in sampling

    Using a random sampling technique to select individuals resulted in
    **unbiased estimates** of parameters.  In other words, our statistics did not
    tend to over- or under-estimate the parameter, but balanced these errors
    instead.  (This assumes no other source of bias.)
    
When evaluating a statistical study, the first thing that should be considered
is the *appropriate scope of the conclusions*, that is to say the types of
conclusions that are justified for this type of study.  The following table
gives some advice on what conclusions can be drawn based on whether or not there was random sampling.

.. admonition:: A study on flossing and gum disease (experiment)

    A recent study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of flossing on
    gum disease.  A group of 500 volunteers were randomly split into two groups.
    The first group was asked to floss once a day and the second group was asked
    to floss after each meal.  Suppose that the group that flossed after every
    meal was much less likely to have gum disease as the group that flossed
    once per day.

    .. mchoice:: mc_evaluate_1
        :answer_a: Yes
        :answer_b: No
        :correct: b
        :feedback_a: Note that the description mentioned that the participants were volunteers.
        :feedback_b: The participants volunteered and were not randomly selected.

        Did this study use random sampling?

    .. mchoice:: mc_evaluate_2
        :answer_a: Yes, the effects the flossing treatments would be the same for the general population.
        :answer_b: No, there is a danger that our estimates of the effects of flossing on gum disease is likely biased.
        :correct: b
        :feedback_a: The participants in the study were volunteers and not a randomly selected sample.
        :feedback_b: The lack of a randomly selected sample means that we are in danger of biased estimates.

        Is it safe to generalize the results of this study?

.. admonition:: Another study on flossing and gum disease (observational study)

    In another study on flossing and gum disease, a random sample of 500 people
    were surveyed on their flossing habits and whether or not they suffered from
    gum disease.  Suppose that it was estimated that the people that flossed 
    after every meal was much less likely to have gum disease as the group 
    that flossed once per day.

    .. mchoice:: mc_evaluate_5
        :answer_a: Yes
        :answer_b: No
        :correct: a
        :feedback_b: The text explicitly mentioned a random sample.

        Did this study use random sampling?

    .. mchoice:: mc_evaluate_6
        :answer_a: Yes, the effects the flossing treatments will be the same for the general population.
        :answer_b: No, there is a danger that our estimates of the effects of flossing on gum disease is likely biased.
        :correct: a
        :feedback_a: Because we are taking a random sample, our statistics should be unbiased and not over- or under-estimate the rates of gum disease in each group.
        :feedback_b: What is the effect of random sampling on bias and a statistics ability to estimate a parameter?

        Is it safe to generalize the results of this study?
