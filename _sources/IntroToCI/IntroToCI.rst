Introduction to Confidence Intervals
====================================

In this chapter we will introduce the some important ideas from statistics.  We
will be focusing on quantitative data and in particular *estimation* of a 
population parameter.

When asking questions about some population of individuals, the ideal situation
is collecting information on all of the individual of interest.  This is referred
to as *taking a census* of the population.  Most of the time, it is not feasible
to collect information on the entire population.  In this case we collect data
on a sample of the population and use this information to make educated guesses
about the population.  This is referred to as **statistical inference**.  More
specifically, in statistical inference, we use *sample statistics* to make
inferences (guesses) about *population parameters*.

.. glossary::
    Statistical Inference
        The process of making educated guess about population parameters using
        information collected from a random sample, e.g. a sample statistic.

.. note::

    The federal government of the United States takes a "census" every 10 years,
    but there are a number of reasons this census falls short of the statistical
    definition.

    1. The population is defined over *households* not *individual citizens*. 
    2. The Census Bureau only attempts to collect a small amount of information on all households.  The long form is collected on a sample of households.
    3. There is a fraction of the population for which it is nearly impossible to survey

Notation for Parameters and Statistics
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In statistics there is a very big distinction between parameters (number
describing a population) and statistics (numbers describing a sample).

.. admonition:: Distinction between Parameters and Statistics

    1. Parameters are thought of a the exact values that we would like to make guesses about.  They are generally too expensive to find exactly and are almost always unknown.
    2. Statistics are thought of as a guess of the value of a parameter.  They are not particularly interesting in their own right. 

The difference between parameters and statistics is so important that we use
difference symbols to represent each.  The first summary method that we will 
focus on is the mean or average of quantitative data.  The symbol that we use
for a population mean (parameter) is :math:`\mu`, while the symbol we use for a
sample mean (statistic) is :math:`\bar{x}`.  The following table gives the
symbols for various parameters and statistics we will work with in this
course.

The first and most important fact that you need to realize when working with
statistics is **statistics vary from sample to sample**.  This is known as
*sampling variability* and most of the procedures in statistics are methods for
dealing with sampling variability.

.. glossary::
    Sampling Variability
        Sampling variability refers to the natural variation in statistics taken
        from different samples. It is very important to quantify this variability.
    Standard Error
        The **standard error** is the estimated standard deviation of the
        sample statistics.  It is an important measure of sampling variability.

To get an idea of the typical location of (center) and variability between
(spread) sample statistics, we study the *sampling distribution*.

.. glossary::
    Sampling Distribution
        The distribution of a statistic when repeatedly sampled from the same
        population with the same sample size.

The next figure shows a simulated sampling distribution for the sample mean.
Each of the 40 dots represents a sample mean from a sample of 10 individuals 
and together these statistics for the sampling distribution.  We are 
interested in the properties of this distribution, in particular the 
*shape*, *center*, and *spread* of the statistics.  To get a better idea of
these qualities of the sampling distribution, we would need to sample many more
statistics.

Recall that statistical inference is the process of using sample statistics to
make guesses/inferences about a population parameter.  One of the primary
examples of this type of inference is *estimating the value of a parameter*.

In this section, we discuss the two types of estimates we can make (point and
interval estimates), explore the proportion of sample means in a sampling
distribution that fall within 2 standard errors of the mean, leverage this
proportion to develop a good margin of error for a sample mean, put this all
together to construct a confidence interval for the mean, and investigate what
a statistician means when claiming to be "95% confident."

.. note::

    The *other* standard type of statistical inference involves testing a
    hypothesis about a parameter, a topic that we will devote more time on later
    in the course.

Point Estimates and Interval Estimates for Parameters
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When estimating the value of a parameter, we can chose between one of two types
of estimates.

.. glossary::
    Point Estimate
        A **point estimate** is a single values estimate of the parameter (i.e.
        one number).  Examples of point estimates are sample statistics like the
        sample mean and sample standard deviation that are used as point
        estimates for the population mean and population standard deviation,
        respectively.
    Interval Estimate
       An **interval estimate** consists of a range of values that we believe
       are likely to contain the actual parameter.  Interval estimates usually
       come with a measure of how confident we are in the estimate (e.g. 95%
       confident).

When possible, it is best to use an interval estimate, because

1. We get a measurement of accuracy, as in how often the interval will 
   successfully contain the parameter.  This is called the *confidence level* 
   of the interval. An interval that comes with a confidence level is called a 
   *confidence interval*.
2. We get a sense of the precision of the estimate, which can be seen in the
   width of the interval.  Specifically, more precise estimates have narrower
   confidence intervals.

.. mchoice:: mc_type_estimate_2
    :answer_a: Point Estimate
    :answer_b: Interval Estimate
    :correct: b

    We are estimate that the population mean height of all Winona State students is between 65 and 69 inches.

Approximating the Standard Error of a Statistic
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When constructing a confidence interval for the population mean, we will
construct the interval by creating a buffer around the sample mean.  To create
this buffer, we add and subtract the *margin of error* to/from the sample mean.  
The right width of buffer is dependent on how 
spread out the sample means tend to be, i.e. the spread of the sampling 
distribution.  The specific measure of spread that we use is the estimated 
standard deviation of the sample means, which is referred to as the 
*standard error of the mean*.

.. glossary::
    Margin of Error
        The **margin of error** is the buffer that is added to and subtracted 
        from the sample mean to construct an interval with a good chance of 
        containing the population mean.
    Standard Error of the Mean
        Our estimate of the standard deviation of all sample means, taken from
        random samples of the same size, is called **the standard error of the
        mean** and demoted with SE.

.. mchoice:: mc_definition_SE
    :answer_a:  the amount of buffer that is added to and subtracted from the sample mean.
    :answer_b:  a common mistake made by students in a statistics class when calculating the mean.
    :answer_c: the estimated standard deviation of the distribution of sample means.
    :correct: c

    The standard error of the mean is ...

Plus or Minus Two Standard Error and the Middle 95% of Statistics
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For simplicity, we will focus on constructing a 95% confidence interval.  It
turns out that when the distribution of a statistic is symmetric and
bell-shaped, going out 2 SE from the population mean will cover about 95% of the
sample means.

To illustrate this fact, we have simulated the distribution of the sample mean
using the `StatKey Website
<http://www.lock5stat.com/StatKey/sampling_1_quant/sampling_1_quant.html>`_,
which is depicted in the figure shown below.  The middle 95% of the sample means
are shown with block dots, and we have colored the largest and smallest 2.5% of
the sample means red.  Furthermore, we can use this distribution to estimate the
SE of the mean, which can be found in the top right of the graph. Notice the 
adding and subtracting 2 SE to the population mean leads to upper and lower
bounds that are very close to the cut offs for the middle 95% of the
distribution. 

|image5|

In the above figure we see that the limits generated by adding and subtracting 2
SEs from the population mean (5.79 and 8.93) are very close to the cut-offs of
the middle 95% of the distribution (5.83 and 8.93).

.. caution::

    The above result will only work for distributions that are symmetric and
    bell shaped.  We will need a different approach for skewed distributions.

Due to the fact that about 95% of the sample means are within 2 standard errors
of the population mean, it makes sense to use this distance as the margin of
error for a 95% confidence interval.

.. admonition:: The Margin of Error for a 95% Confidence Interval for the Mean

    The **margin of error** for a 95% confidence interval is given by

    .. math::

        MoE = 2*SE

    This margin of error works because

    1. "A sample mean is in the middle 95% of the sample means" implies that the
       population mean will be within 2 SE of the sample mean.  
    2. Only the sample means in the lowest and highest 2.5% of the distribution
       will fail to capture the population mean in an interval using this
       margin of error.

In other words, if the sample mean is *close enough* to the population mean, the
population mean is *close enough* to the sample mean.

.. admonition:: The Main Point

    If the sample mean is *close enough* to the population mean, the population 
    mean is *close enough* to the sample mean.  Using a margin of error of 2
    standard errors means that about 95% of sample means are *close enough*.

          
.. mchoice:: mc_margin_95_percent
    :answer_a: 100%
    :answer_b: 95%
    :answer_c: We can't determine X, as the samples were randomly selected.
    :correct: b
    :feedback_a: You are too *confident* (that is a statistics joke)
    :feedback_c: While random samples are uncertain in the short term, they are predicitable in the long run.

     The interval constructed by adding and subtracting 2 SE to/from the
     population mean will contain X% of the sample means.  Identify the value of
     X.

Being (95%) Confident
+++++++++++++++++++++

Let's make sure it is clear what it means to be 95% confident by considering the
following figure, again created using `StatKey Website
<http://www.lock5stat.com/StatKey/sampling_1_quant/sampling_1_quant.html>`_.  Each of the dots is a sample mean and each of the
line segments extends out 2 standard errors.  The population mean is
located at the solid vertical line, recall that our goal in using constructing
such an interval is to capture the population mean.

|image6|

The intervals that are green successfully captured
the population mean, and the intervals that failed to capture the population
mean are colored red.  Notice that about 95% of the intervals successfully 
capture the population mean.

.. admonition:: Being "95% confident"

    When a statistician says that she is "95% confident", she means that she is
    using a procedure, that when used repeatedly on many random samples, will
    work 95% of the time.

.. caution::

    We purposely avoid the phrase "95% probability".  This is because each
    specific interval is either works 100% of the time (captured the mean) or
    fails 100% of the time (fails to capture the mean).  Using "95% probability"
    in place of "95% confidence" makes it sound like this specific interval 
    only works some of the time, when in fact it either always works or never 
    works.

.. mchoice:: mc_meaning_of_confidence
    :answer_a: We are really pretty sure of the result.
    :answer_b: The interval we constructed from a specific sample will work 95% of the time.
    :answer_c: We are using a procedure that works 95% of the time, when applied to many, many samples.
    :correct: c
    :feedback_a: This answer is too vague, try being more specific.
    :feedback_b: Unfortunately, any single interval either works 100% of the time or 0% of the time.
    :feedback_c: Statisticians define success "in the long run."

    To a statistician, what does it mean to be "95% confident"?
