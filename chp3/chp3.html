<p><strong>*
Example 3.1: MythBusters and the Yawning Experiment*</strong></p>
<p>MythBusters, a popular television program on the Discovery Channel, once
conducted an experiment to investigate whether or not yawning is
contagious. The premise of the experiment was to invite a stranger to
sit in a booth for an extended period of time. Fifty subjects were said
to be tested in total, of which 34 were &#8220;seeded&#8221; with a yawn by the
person conducting the experiment. The other 16 were not given a yawn
seed. Using a two-way mirror and a hidden camera, the experimenters
observed and recorded the results which are given below.</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="43%" />
<col width="16%" />
<col width="26%" />
<col width="15%" />
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head">&nbsp;</th>
<th class="head">Yawned</th>
<th class="head">Did not Yawn</th>
<th class="head">Total</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-even"><td>Seeded with a yawn</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>24</td>
<td>34</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Not seeded with a yawn</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>12</td>
<td>16</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>*Research Hypothesis*: Those “seeded” with a yawn are more likely to
actually yawn than those who are not seeded.</strong></p>
<p>When we analyze data on two variables, our first step is to distinguish
between the <strong>response</strong> variable and the <strong>explanatory</strong> (or
<strong>predictor</strong>) variable.</p>

<li><p class="first">Even if the seeding of a yawn had absolutely no effect on whether or

<p><strong>*Statistical Inference: Conducting a Simulation Study with Playing
Cards*</strong></p>
<p>The above <em>descriptive analysis</em> tells us what we have learned about
the 50 subjects in the study. Our next goal is to make <em>inferences</em>
beyond what happened in the study (i.e., we want to make general
statements about the population). Does the higher proportion of
yawners in the seeded group provide convincing evidence that being
seeded with a yawn actually makes a person more likely to yawn? Note
that it is possible that random chance alone could have led to this
large of a difference. That is, while it is <em>possible</em> that the yawn
seeding had no effect and the MythBusters happened to observe more
yawners in the seeded group just by chance, the key question is
whether it is <em>probable</em>.</p>
<p>We will answer this question by replicating the experiment over and
over again, but in a situation where we know that yawn seeding has no
effect (the null model). We’ll start with 14 yawners and 36
non-yawners, and we’ll randomly assign 34 of these 50 subjects to the
seeded group and the remaining 16 to the non-seeded group.</p>
<p>Note that we could use playing cards to replicate this experiment:
let 14 red cards represent the yawners, and let 36 black cards
represent the non-yawners. Shuffle the cards well, and randomly deal
out 34 to be the seeded group. This is the first run of our
simulation study. Construct the contingency table to show the number
of yawners and non-yawners in each group from the first run of our
simulation study.</p>

actually yawns—we simply assume there are 14 people who will yawn no

that random assignment of yawners to groups will result in 10 or more

</li>
<li><p class="first">The MythBusters reported the following results: 25% yawned of those

Then, they cited the &#8220;large sample size&#8221; and the 4% difference in the
proportion that yawned between the seeded and non-seeded group to
confidently conclude that yawn seed had a significant effect on the
subjects. Therefore, they concluded that the yawn is decisively
contagious. Do you agree or disagree with their answer? Justify your
reasoning.</p>
<p><strong>*Statistical Inference: Fisher’s Exact Test to Obtain Exact
p-values*</strong></p>
<p>We just used a simulation study to investigate the Mythbusters’
research hypothesis. This is a valid analysis; however, it provides
only an approximate p-value. We can obtain the exact p-value using
probability theory and a distribution known as the hypergeometric
distribution. Details about the hypergeometric distribution are
beyond the scope of this course; however, we will discuss <strong>Fisher’s
Exact Test</strong> which uses the hypergeometric distribution to calculate
p-values. This is easily carried out in JMP.</p>

<p>JMP has already used the hypergeometric probability distribution to
calculate the probability of observing results at least as extreme as
those observed in the MythBusters actual experiment. Now, you can use
this output to carry out the test.</p>

<p>“A study published in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>
(Butler and Baumeister, 1998) investigated a conjecture that having an
observer with a vested interest would decrease subjects’ performance on
a skill-based task. Subjects were given time to practice playing a video
game that required them to navigate an obstacle course as quickly as
possible. They were then told to play the game one final time with an
observer present. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups.
One group (A) was told that the participant and observer would each win
$3 if the participant beat a certain threshold time, and the other group
(B) was told only that the participant would win the prize if the
threshold were beaten. The threshold was chosen to be a time that they
beat in 30% of their practice turns. The following results are very
similar to those found in the experiment: 3 of the 12 subjects in group
A beat the threshold, and 8 of 12 subjects in group B achieved success.”</p>

<p>The random assignment of treatments used by researchers in a designed experiment should balance out between the treatment groups any other factors that might be related to the response variable.

<p class="last">On the other hand, observational studies establish only that an association exists between the predictor and response variable. With observational studies, it is always possible that there are other lurking variables not controlled for in the study that may be impacting the response.

<p>Note that the “Vested Interest and Task Performance” study is an example
of a designed experiment since participants were randomly assigned to
the two groups. We were trying to show that having a vested interest
<em>caused</em> a decreased task performance. The small p-value rules out
observing the decreased performance in the vested interest group simply
by chance, and the randomization of subjects to treatment groups should
have balanced out any other factors that might explain the difference.
So, the most likely explanation left is that having a vested interest
really is the cause of the decreased task performance.</p>

CHI-SQUARE TEST (ALTERNATIVE TO FISHER’S EXACT TEST)*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*
*</strong>Fisher’s exact test from the previous section can be used for
either upper-tailed, lower-tailed, or two-tailed hypothesis tests for
differences in two proportions. The <em>Chi-square test</em> is another
procedure we can use to test for differences between two proportions.
However, this procedure can be used for <strong>ONLY TWO-SIDED TESTS</strong>!
Consider the data from Example 4.4.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">H<sub>0</sub>: The proportion of families afflicted by alcoholism is
the same regardless of whether or</div>
<div class="line">not the female in the family suffers from primary unipolar

<div class="line">H<sub>a</sub>: The proportion of families afflicted by alcoholism
<em>differs</em> depending on whether or not</div>
<div class="line">the female in the family suffers from primary unipolar depression.</div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>With the chi-square test, the evidence from our sample will consist of a
<em>test statistic</em>, which for this test is given as follows:</p>

<div><p>Recall that the Chi-Square test uses a distribution known as the

takes on only positive numbers and is a continuous distribution. In
addition, this distribution is indexed by its degrees of freedom (or
df). For this test, this is given by df = (r - 1)(c - 1). When the
null hypothesis is true, the test-statistic follows the chi-square
distribution with df = (r - 1)(c - 1). .</p>
<p>The following graph shows the chi-square distribution with df = 1.
The p-value is found by plotting the chi-square test statistic on

<p><strong>*Step 3: Write a conclusion addressing the original research

<p><strong>*CONFIDENCE INTERVAL FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN PROPORTIONS*</strong></p>
<p>Recall our conclusion from Example 3.4 after conducting a hypothesis
test: “We have evidence the proportion of families afflicted by
alcoholism differs depending on whether or not the female in the family
had primary unipolar depression.” The next natural question is as
follows: how large is the difference in these proportions?</p>
<p>We can start by finding the difference in these proportions obtained
from the sample:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><sub>Alcoholism|Depression</sub> =</li>
<li><sub>Alcoholism|Control</sub> =</li>
<li><sub>Alcoholism|Depression</sub> - <sub>Alcoholism|Control</sub> =</li>
</ul>
<p>Interpret this difference in the sample proportions:</p>
<p>Next, note that when discussing the results of the Alcoholism and
Depression example, we want to make conclusions that allow us to compare
the alcoholism rate in the POPULATION of families of all females
affected by depression versus those who are not. The difference we just
calculated describes the size of the difference in the proportions
obtained in our SAMPLE. To generalize these results to the population,
we must calculate a confidence interval for the risk difference.</p>
<p>To find the confidence interval of interest for the previous example, we
need the following.</p>
<p>Let = <sub>Alcoholism|Depression</sub> and = <sub>Alcoholism|Control</sub>.</p>

in a <em>Fox News</em> article titled “Adopted teens may be at higher risk of
suicide.” This article described the results as follows:</p>
<p><a href="#id19"><span class="problematic" id="id20">*</span></a>[The researchers] examined data from an existing University of
Minnesota study of 692 adopted children and 540 non-adopted siblings in
Minnesota… All of the adopted kids, who were between 11 and 21 years old
during the study period, had been taken in by their families before age
two. Almost three quarters of the adopted children were born abroad,
most of the foreign-born children were from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.reuters.com/places/south-korea">South
Korea</a> and 60 percent of
those were girls. At the beginning of the study, and again about three
years later, the researchers asked participating families if the
children had made a suicide attempt. Over the three years of the study,
56 children attempted suicide at least once, according to the family
members&#8217; reports. Of those kids, 47 were adopted and nine were not
adopted.

<p><strong>*CALCULATING RISKS AND THE RELATIVE RISK*</strong></p>
<p>The confidence interval calculated above helps us to quantify the
discrepancy in the proportion of adopted versus non-adopted that had
attempted suicide. We could also measure the amount of discrepancy
between these two proportions based on something called <strong>*relative
risk*</strong>. This involves taking the <em>ratio</em> of the two proportions instead
of the <em>difference</em>.</p>
<p>Note that in the previous example, our estimate of the <em>proportion</em> of
adopted children that had attempted suicide could be viewed as an
estimate of the <em>probability</em> of an adopted child attempting suicide
(the same could be said for the non-adopted group). When we calculate
the probability of an adverse event, we sometimes refer to this
probability as a <strong>risk</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, we can calculate the <strong>risk</strong> of attempting suicide for
both groups in this study as follows:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">

follows:</p>

<p><strong>*CALCULATING ODDS AND THE ODDS RATIO*</strong></p>
<p>Another quantity that is often used to describe differences in
categorical outcomes between groups is the <em>odds ratio</em>. This ratio is
used more commonly in practice than the relative risk ratio; however, it
is more difficult to interpret and is sometimes harder to understand.</p>
<p>Before computing an odds ratio, we first need to compute the <em>odds</em> for
both groups:</p>
<p><strong>*Odds*</strong>: Consider our Adoption and Suicide Attempt example. For each
group (Adopted and Not Adopted), the odds of attempting suicide is
computed as the number of subjects in that group that attempted suicide
divided by the number in that group that did not attempt suicide.</p>
<p>Recall the contingency table for this example.</p>

<p>The <strong>*odds ratio*</strong> is then simply the ratio of the odds for the two
groups:</p>

children as for non-adopted children.</p>

risk cannot be estimated because the study design does not allow
us to estimate the probability of the disease for those with or
for those without the risk factor (see the Example 3.8 for

<div class="line">The actual study described here in Example 3.11 involved a single
random sample, so this is technically a chi-square test of
independence. If the researchers had taken separate random samples of
U.S. citizens from each political affiliation group, how would our
results have changed? The answer is… not much. We would have
calculated the chi-square test statistic in the same way, so we would
have obtained the same test statistic and the same p-value. Our
conclusion might have focused on there being a significant difference
in the proportion that supports the war across political affiliation
instead of focusing on there being a significant relationship between
the two variables, but the overall story would have remained the same.</div>
