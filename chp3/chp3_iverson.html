<h3>Statistical Inference: Conducting a Simulation Study with Playing Cards<a class="headerlink" href="#statistical-inference-conducting-a-simulation-study-with-playing-cards" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The above <em>descriptive analysis</em> tells us what we have learned about
the 50 subjects in the study. Our next goal is to make <em>inferences</em>
beyond what happened in the study (i.e., we want to make general
statements about the population). Does the higher proportion of
yawners in the seeded group provide convincing evidence that being
seeded with a yawn actually makes a person more likely to yawn? Note
that it is possible that random chance alone could have led to this
large of a difference. That is, while it is <em>possible</em> that the yawn
seeding had no effect and the MythBusters happened to observe more
yawners in the seeded group just by chance, the key question is
whether it is <em>probable</em>.</p>
<p>We will answer this question by replicating the experiment over and
over again, but in a situation where we know that yawn seeding has no
effect (the null model). We’ll start with 14 yawners and 36
non-yawners, and we’ll randomly assign 34 of these 50 subjects to the
seeded group and the remaining 16 to the non-seeded group.</p>
<p>Note that we could use playing cards to replicate this experiment:
let 14 red cards represent the yawners, and let 36 black cards
represent the non-yawners. Shuffle the cards well, and randomly deal
out 34 to be the seeded group. This is the first run of our
simulation study. Construct the contingency table to show the number
of yawners and non-yawners in each group from the first run of our
simulation study.</p>

<p>Next, note that if you know the number of yawners in the Seeded group,
then you can fill in the rest of the cells in the contingency table. So,
for the rest of the simulated runs, <strong>we need only keep track of the
number of yawners in the Seeded group</strong>. Record the number of yawners in
the Seeded group from your first simulated experiment in the table
below. Then, repeat this randomization process nine more times,
recording your results in the table.</p>

game that required them to navigate an obstacle course as quickly as
possible. They were then told to play the game one final time with an
observer present. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups.
One group (A) was told that the participant and observer would each win
$3 if the participant beat a certain threshold time, and the other group
(B) was told only that the participant would win the prize if the
threshold were beaten. The threshold was chosen to be a time that they
beat in 30% of their practice turns. The following results are very
similar to those found in the experiment: 3 of the 12 subjects in group
A beat the threshold, and 8 of 12 subjects in group B achieved success.”</div></blockquote>

<p>Reconsider the “Vested Interest and Task Performance” example.  Fisher’s exact
test provided evidence that the proportion of successes was in fact smaller for
the vested interest group (p-value = .0498). Now, the question is this: can we
conclude that having a vested interest really is the <em>cause</em> of the decreased
performance?</p>
<p>The answer to this question lies in whether the experiment itself was a
designed experiment or an observational study.</p>
<dl class="glossary docutils">
<dt id="term-observational-study">Observational Study</dt>
<dd>An <strong>*observational study*</strong> involves collecting and analyzing data <em>without randomly</em> assigning treatments to experimental units.</dd>
<dt id="term-designed-experiment">Designed Experiment</dt>
<dd>On the other hand, in a <strong>*designed experiment*</strong>, a treatment is <em>randomly</em> imposed on individual subjects in order to observe whether the treatment causes a change in the response.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="admonition-key-statistical-idea admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Key statistical idea:</p>
<p>The random assignment of treatments used by researchers in a designed
experiment should balance out between the treatment groups any other factors
that might be related to the response variable. Therefore, designed
experiments <em>can</em> be used to establish a cause-and-effect relationship (as
long as the p-value is small).</p>
<p class="last">On the other hand, observational studies establish only that an association
exists between the predictor and response variable. With observational
studies, it is always possible that there are other lurking variables not
controlled for in the study that may be impacting the response. Since we
can’t be certain these other factors are balanced out between treatment
groups, it is possible that these other factors could explain the difference
between treatment groups.</p>
</div>
<p>Note that the “Vested Interest and Task Performance” study is an example
of a designed experiment since participants were randomly assigned to
the two groups. We were trying to show that having a vested interest
<em>caused</em> a decreased task performance. The small p-value rules out
observing the decreased performance in the vested interest group simply
by chance, and the randomization of subjects to treatment groups should
have balanced out any other factors that might explain the difference.
So, the most likely explanation left is that having a vested interest
really is the cause of the decreased task performance.</p>

upper-tailed, lower-tailed, or two-tailed hypothesis tests for differences in
two proportions. The <em>Chi-square test</em> is another procedure we can use to test
for differences between two proportions.  However, this procedure can be used
for <strong>ONLY TWO-SIDED TESTS</strong>!  Consider the data from Example 4.4.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Recall that the Chi-Square test uses a distribution known as the
chi-square (χ:sup:<cite>2</cite>) distribution. The chi-square distribution
takes on only positive numbers and is a continuous distribution. In
addition, this distribution is indexed by its degrees of freedom (or
df). For this test, this is given by df = (r - 1)(c - 1). When the
null hypothesis is true, the test-statistic follows the chi-square
distribution with df = (r - 1)(c - 1). .</p>
<p>The following graph shows the chi-square distribution with df = 1.
The p-value is found by plotting the chi-square test statistic on
the x-axis and calculating the area under the curve above the test
statistic.</p>
<p>Note that the output for the chi-square test automatically appears when
you select <strong>Analyze &gt; Fit Y by X.</strong></p>

Korea</a> and 60 percent of
those were girls. At the beginning of the study, and again about three
years later, the researchers asked participating families if the
children had made a suicide attempt. Over the three years of the study,
56 children attempted suicide at least once, according to the family

<h2>Calculating Risks and the Relative Risk<a class="headerlink" href="#calculating-risks-and-the-relative-risk" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The confidence interval calculated above helps us to quantify the
discrepancy in the proportion of adopted versus non-adopted that had
attempted suicide. We could also measure the amount of discrepancy
between these two proportions based on something called <strong>relative
risk</strong>. This involves taking the <em>ratio</em> of the two proportions instead
of the <em>difference</em>.</p>
<p>Note that in the previous example, our estimate of the <em>proportion</em> of
adopted children that had attempted suicide could be viewed as an
estimate of the <em>probability</em> of an adopted child attempting suicide
(the same could be said for the non-adopted group). When we calculate
the probability of an adverse event, we sometimes refer to this
probability as a <strong>risk</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, we can calculate the <strong>risk</strong> of attempting suicide for
both groups in this study as follows:</p>

<li>An odds ratio of 1.0 implies that there is no observable difference
between the two odds. This is always the reference value!</li>
<li>Odds ratios are often used in health care experiments when we want to
determine how much more likely a subject is to develop a disease
when they have some risk factor as opposed to not having that
risk factor. In a <em>retrospective study (</em>also called a
<em>case-control study)</em>, samples are drawn from those who have the
disease and those who do not. It is then determined whether each
subject has the risk factor. In this type of study, the relative
risk cannot be estimated because the study design does not allow
us to estimate the probability of the disease for those with or
for those without the risk factor (see the Example 3.8 for
clarification on this). So, we must use the odds ratio instead of
the relative risk for these studies. This is why statisticians
put so much emphasis on the odds ratio even though the relative
risk is easier to understand and interpret.</li>
<li>If the probability of the outcome under study in the general
population is very low, then the odds ratio is typically close to
the relative risk and can thus be used as an <em>estimate</em> of the
relative risk (see Example 3.9 for clarification on this). <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">**</span></a><a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">*</span></a></li>

<p>To discuss the calculation of the relative risk and the odds ratio in
JMP, let’s once again consider the Adoption and Suicide Attempt
example. The data should be entered in JMP as follows.</p>

<p>Click OK. On the output that appears, click on the red drop-down arrow
next to <strong>Contingency Analysis…</strong> and select <strong>Relative Risk</strong>.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../_images/image611.png"><img alt="image3027" src="../_images/image611.png" style="width: 2.89916in; height: 1.45811in;" /></a></p>

<p>If you also ask for the <strong>Odds Ratio</strong> from this red drop-down arrow,
JMP returns this quantity:</p>

<p>Note that JMP is by default computing the odds of NOT attempting suicide
since this column appears first in the contingency table. It is then
computing the odds ratio with the Adopted Group in the numerator, since
this row appears first in the table.</p>

<p>In March of 2003, the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project
commissioned Princeton Survey Research Associates to develop and carry
out a survey of what Americans thought about the recent war in Iraq.
Some of the results of this survey of over 1,400 American adults are
given in the JMP data file <strong>IraqWar.JMP</strong>. (<em>Source:</em> <em>McClave &amp;

<li>Do you ever go online to access the Internet or World Wide Web?</li>

<h3>Finding the p-value:<a class="headerlink" href="#finding-the-p-value" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Chi-Square test uses a distribution known as the chi-square <span class="math">\chi^2</span>
distribution.  The chi-square distribution takes on only positive numbers and is
a <em>continuous</em> distribution. In addition, this distribution is indexed by its
degrees of freedom (or df).  For this test, this is given by</p>
<div class="math">
\[df = (r - 1)(c - 1).\]</div>
<p>You can use the following function in EXCEL to find the p-value:
<strong>=CHIDIST(test statistic, df).</strong></p>
<p>The following graph shows the chi-square distribution with df = 2.
The p-value is found by plotting the chi-square test statistic on
the x-axis and calculating the area under the curve above the test
statistic.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Write a conclusion in the context of the problem</p>
<p>Finally, since we have determined that there is a significant
association between support for the Iraq war and political
affiliation, we can describe this relationship based on the patterns
displayed in the mosaic plot.</p>

<p>In the context of our Iraq War example, some statisticians might
differentiate between these two versions of the chi-square test as
follows.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../_images/image563.png"><img alt="image3060" src="../_images/image563.png" style="width: 6.33in; height: 3.38in;" /></a></p>
<p>Note that the choice of homogeneity versus independence depends on
only the study design and that the phrasing of the research question
is slightly different between the two versions.
The actual study described here in Example 3.11 involved a single
random sample, so this is technically a chi-square test of
independence. If the researchers had taken separate random samples of
U.S. citizens from each political affiliation group, how would our
results have changed? The answer is… not much. We would have
calculated the chi-square test statistic in the same way, so we would
have obtained the same test statistic and the same p-value. Our
conclusion might have focused on there being a significant difference
in the proportion that supports the war across political affiliation
instead of focusing on there being a significant relationship between
the two variables, but the overall story would have remained the same.</p>
